overview
global diversified industries operates in the modular
building construction industry , and strategically targets the
california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in
central
california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art
manufacturing facility .
throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building
its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a
state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the
requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth .
through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million
capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state
of
california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to
become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the
west coast .
gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion
school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by
california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion
an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before
the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and
subsequently invests in those companies .
global diversified has taken numerous strategic
development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating
strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive
growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with
previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum
businesses .
in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue
projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state
approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit
facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing
facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition
candidates through its aggressive growth plan .
profile
gdvi is a holding company that currently
operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a
modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work
and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and
manufacturing of modular type structures .
its principal customer base is currently educational
( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and
municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of
portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two -
story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures
are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved
building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications
administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .
global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing
educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback
clause . the state of
california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular
classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful
bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities
portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the
originating school district . this process saves school districts
valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids .
a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may
have access to future business for up to five years , depending on
the term of the piggyback contract .
the strategic focus on california schools
since 1998 ,
california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new
classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures .
there are five compelling reasons for this trend :
modular
classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks )
they cost
significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 )
they offer
greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings
they are easier
to finance
they provide
financing incentives
to cope with population growth , the state department of
education estimates that
california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the
next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms .
due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout
the california education sector , public and private schools are
expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their
additional classroom requirements over the next four years .
the california schools budget crisis
on
november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond
proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by
california
voters .
this bond measure passage does not include an approximate
$ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school
districts throughout the state .
a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the
voters on the march 2004 .
these bond measures are about three times higher than the
record $ 9 . 2 billion bond
california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these
bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which
include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular
classroom construction and renovations .
money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and
private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at
community colleges and other institutions of higher learning
throughout
california .
gdvi business infrastructure
among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated ,
state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes
equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are
specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular
structures .
gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking
to add to its workforce as demand increases .
operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square
foot operating structure .
wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets ,

wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles

"Subject: cox exploration
darren , we had a situation in december that we need your help to resolve .
deal # 125836 we have been purchasing gas from cox exploration on pg & e
hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility . this purchase
agreement terminated 11 / 30 / 99 . i didn ' t path the gas on pgeh , however , i
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at
thompsonville . i didn ' t catch this and the deal on the hpl side appeared to
be a valid flow issue for kim vaughn . the plant continued to confirm this
gas .
we have tried working through the pipeline , but they state that they will not
know anything until the 15 th . can you contact the producer and ask them to
reverify this with the pipeline ? i would like kim to be able to zero confirm
and send back to pops so volume management will not allocate up to the
producer level .
also i just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at
the same meter with tribo production . should there have been an expected
volume in this deal ? is it possible that cox exploration sold their interest
in this well to tribo . it may turn out that we should have flowed the gas
after all .",0

"Subject: re : ua 4 - meter 1441 for 11 / 97 - falfurrias
howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .

"Subject: [ ilug ] please kindly get back to me
from : mr . desmond stevens
urgent assistance .
you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . i am mr . desmond stevens , the first son of dr . dennis stevens , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i was furnished with viable information from the world trade centre here in amsterdam , the netherlands and decided to write you .
before the death of my father , he had taken me to amsterdam to deposit the sum of ten million , five hundred thousand united states dollars ( us $ 10 , 500 , 000 ) in a security company , as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe . this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farm in swaziland . this land problem came when zimbabwe president mr . robert mugabe , introduced a new land act that wholly affected rich white farmers and some few black farmers . this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society . infact , a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act of which my father was one of the victims . it is against this background that my family and i who are currently staying in amsterdam decided to transfer my father ’ s money to
a foreign account . since the law of the netherlands prohibit a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any account or to be involved in any financial transaction .
as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands for the fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . as a businessman , whom i have entrusted my future and my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , all i need you to do for me is to make arrangement and come to amsterdam , the netherlands so that you can open the non - resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas . this money i intend to use for investment . i have
options to offer you , first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for the transaction , or you can go into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country . whichever option you choose , feel free to notify me . i have mapped out 5 % of this money for all expenses incurred in processing this transaction . if you do not prefer a partnership , i am willing to give you 25 % of the money while the remaining 70 % that is meant for me , will be for the investment in your country .
please , contact me with the above telephone and e - mail address , while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction .
yours faithfully ,
desmond stevens .

"Subject: re : natural gas storage item
vince -
something very interesting about natural gas storage ( from the class ) .
the industry is rapidly adopting what are called "" operational balancing
agreements , "" where the pipeline contracts with the producers and ldc ' s
( public utilities ) to handle all "" imbalances "" in shipping , namely all
production shortfalls or overages or consumption likewise . shippers then
always "" book "" what is scheduled to happen , and not what actually happens .
the end result is that storage facillities associated with production regions
are used to smooth out not only weekday - weekend seasonal patterns ( the
well - known "" parking "" ) but to insure issues of wellhead output as well .
cutting to the chase , storage facilities in producing regions are operated to
insure the integrity of the pipeline system , and estimated marketed
production is likely to be a better estimate of actual flow at the pipeline ' s
receipt meter than is production less local storage .

cera knowledge areas : refined products
us margin highlights
* responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels ,
us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel
to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at
exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average
$ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel
lower than this year ' s first quarter average .
* high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly ,
averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel
from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented
values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater
that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record
high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .
* jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the
october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in
correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight
fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of
$ 5 . 75 per barrel .
* margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per
barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the
recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter
months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel
below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the
historical range .
us demand highlights
* apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million
barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four
weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last
year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .
cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder
temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .
* reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94
mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this
time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million
barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high
level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,
particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during
the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter
months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .
* apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level
to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the
demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .
* reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks
ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a
slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is
currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout
the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd
range during the first quarter of 2001 .
us inventory highlights
* primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing
almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels
and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to
23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent
below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the
past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .
* distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of
october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .
despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped
boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .
primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at
their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not
anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting
demand requirements - albeit at a high price .
* jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to
reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had
been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull
from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be
adequate for the winter .
* inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply
from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks
ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a
drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen
because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and

subject : intelligence : el paso capacity - - someone has upped the ante but match
still possible
negotiated el paso deal topped
el paso confirmed that someone had upped the ante on the negotiated deal
for slightly
more than 1 . 2 bcf / d in firm capacity to the california border that was
announced friday
( see daily gpi , dec . 13 ) . a higher bid was submitted prior to
wednesday ' s 1 p . m . mst
deadline in a four - day open season , a pipeline spokesman said . however ,
the original
negotiating party has until this afternoon to match the new price and
retain the capacity .
the new bid was for $ 38 million over one year starting jan . 1 , about $ 8
million more than
the amount in friday ' s announcement ( $ 30 million ) . one source called it
"" ridiculous "" that
someone was willing to pay so much for the space , given that on a
mark - to - market basis
the capacity is worth only about $ 20 - 25 million .
late last week some sources speculated that duke energy was the
recipient of next
year ' s package given its large power generation holdings in california .
a marketer
yesterday said he believed dynegy upped the ante . "" rather than go
through all the
hassles they [ dynegy ] had at ferc with the 1998 - 99 package , they let
someone else do
all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid . that way
no one can
complain that the procedure was tainted . after all , dynegy has quite a
few power plants
in california to keep fueled , and all of their current ft on el paso
expires at the end of
this year . of course , they still could be thwarted if the original
negotiated customer
matches their bid . it may all sound kind of machiavellian but sort of
makes sense . "" other
sources heavily discounted the chances of dynegy being the new high
bidder , pointing out
that the company made significantly less than expected this year because
san
juan / border basis differentials narrowed significantly . a dynegy source
indicated that the
company was involved in the bidding and lost to duke in the first round .
regardless of what happens next year , a marketer noted that the southern
california
border / san juan basis spread continues to compress as socal gas
withdraws from
storage and east - of - california utilities exercise their peaking
contracts because of cold
weather in the rockies and elsewhere in the west . from a december index
spread of 29
cents , the border / basin gap was down to about 18 cents wednesday , she
said .",0

we are not yet finished with jeff ' s presentation , and probably won ' t be
completely finished until tomorrow afternoon - just about the time that
jeff will leave for dallas . in addition , e - mailing the complete
presentation may not be an option due to the size of the file .
i ' ve asked hamd to e - mail you want we have right now so that you can test
it with your system . we ' ll then send a cd with the entire presentation
along with jeff to dallas . i ' ll ask jeff to deliver it to you at the

daron , i apologize for any inconvenience this may cause . if you have
another idea as to how to handle this situation , we ' re certainly willing to
entertain it .

subject : stephen bennett
stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research
group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment
criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a
senior specialist .
after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an
"" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of
a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of
this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""
at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron
designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar
hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,
who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while
functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job
classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional
professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the
proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist
category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected
at this time .
although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work
experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the
weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in
atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,
needing no further training and only minimal supervision .
once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron
values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather
briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation
as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .
stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he
designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather
derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and
liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion
and major upgrade of this web page .
these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,
to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the
advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily
on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his
supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do
not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations
assistance .
in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was
enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a
meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional
title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving
of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

they are both superb students and very hard working individuals , so i do
hope you will consider checking them out in the future ( within a year -
year and a half ) .
i will contact you and / or stinson in the future when they are closer
to finishing up .

"Subject: wharton collaborative research
here is a short note on potential research with wharton . please review and
edit and then we can send some indication to the wharton guys . - - - - - - - - - -
the objective would be to define the amount of risk an enterprise can take ,
and the difference between this and the actual amount of risk the enterprise
chooses to take based on the capital structure and reporting structure . in
particular , one can view enron as a hierarchy of companies , and assuming we
can separately quantify the risks of each unit , what framework would one use
to analyze risk at enron ?
a related question is how one should represent risks in the different
units ? risks may be of different types - - - short - term volatility risk ,
catastrophic risk , liquidity risk , etc - - - what should one focus on for a
first cut ?
another related question is to decide on the optimal amount of insurance
both at the unit level and the enterprise level , and relate the decision to
get insurance to the cost / benefit of insurance .",0

"Subject: stephen bennett
stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research
group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment
criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a
senior specialist .
after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an
"" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of
a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of
this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""
at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron
designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar
hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,
who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while
functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job
classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional
professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the
proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist
category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected
at this time .
although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work
experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the
weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in
atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,
needing no further training and only minimal supervision .
once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron
values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather
briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation
as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .
stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he
designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather
derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and
liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion
and major upgrade of this web page .
these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,
to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the
advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily
on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his
supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do
not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations
assistance .
in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was
enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a
meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional
title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving
of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

subject : re : meter 5892
daren :
sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue , i am with ees now .
karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while i was in transition .
exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis .
december 2000
the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this
e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at
this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will
show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine .
january 2001
again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu
flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other
deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get
this issue resolved .
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024
contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue .

"Subject: flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl
saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in

acadia north
gas project
quest
canada inc . , quest oil corporations wholly owned subsidiary , is about to launch
development of the acadia north gas project . acadia north is the initial launch
project for quest oil . the project was selected based on its reduced risk
characteristics of proven reserves , substantial production in the area and the
projects close proximity to several distribution pipelines allowing immediate
access to market .
the
acadia project is located in southeast alberta near the saskatchewan border . acadia north consists of
two sections totaling 1280 gross acres overlying the vast viking gas target . the
arneson viking pool is a shoreface sand deposit and oriented in a ne - sw
direction . the pool has been encountered by four previously drill wells
since 1972 . the porous sand ranges from 30 feet to 46 feet thick and
contains gas under lain by water . pay zone thickness ranges from 4 feet to
12 feet with a proven and probable recoverable reserve of 8 bcf at a market
value of $ 24 million . according to chapman engineering of calgary , alberta
when including the possible reserves identifies an underlying pool over twice
the pud with a value of $ 45
million .
on
may
20 , 2005
quest oil completed and closed project financing for $ 750 , 000 usd . these
funds will allow for immediate application for licensing and permitting of the
two acadia sections . quest oils operator , transaction oil and
gas ventures has been retained to provide turnkey development through to
tie - in . survey crews are on site and over the next couple of weeks will
determine drill site locations . drill rigs at present are being scheduled
for mid - june and within a two week period will have completed the two well drill
program . well depth is approximately 1 , 800 feet and within two days of
active drilling target depth will be achieved . as the
acadia project progresses through completion and tie - in , it is
expected with a successful drill program , we will be in cash flow within sixty
days .
quest
oil is actively searching and conducting economic reviews on several projects in
north america and abroad . we have spent
considerable amount of time and negotiations with governments in the
middle
east and
are close to entering into a full development program . management will be
releasing information on this endeavor within the next few
weeks .

subject : garp 2001 convention
dear garp 2001 speaker
?
this is just a quick note to keep you up - to - date with developments at the
garp 2001 convention , which will be held in new york between 12 th and 15 th
february , 2001 .
?
thus far , garp 2001 looks set to far exceed our expectations and garp 2000 .
there has been a great deal of interest in the 2001 convention . delegate
bookings have been much higher than this time last year . as a result , we are
set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention earlier this year .
the three workshops and the one - day asset management forum are also very
well received and will probably reach full capacity . i will of course
provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the event .
?
regarding the event itself , i would like a few outstanding issues :
?
1 . presentations : can you please e - mail your presentation to me by 15 th
december , so that i have enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
delegate pack for the convention . ( given the break of the christmas and new
york period , and that the event is being held in new york , i am sure you can
appreciate that there are certain logistical factors that need to be taken
into account , hence the reason why the presentations are required as soon as
possible ) . this is purely for reproduction , we also request you bring your
presentation to the convention on the day in either a floppy disc or a
laptop .
?
2 . audio - visual requirements : can you please inform me of what audio - visual
requirements you may have ( 35 mm slides ; ohp ; lcd projection - notably
powerpoint ) .
?
3 . check list : i have attached a check list for your information . if you
have not returned this already , can you please read and fax it to my
colleague , claire as soon as possible .
?
if you have any questions or queries , please do not hesitate to contact me ,
otherwise i eagerly await your response in due course .
?
i look forward to seeing you in new york in february .
?
kind regards
?

"Subject: alliance info alert
dear generation / power marketing executive :
this alliance info alert includes three items of interest :
1 ) the weekly alliance express newsletter
2 ) listing of recent filings at ferc
3 ) timeline for ferc action on california markets ( attached )
alliance of energy suppliers express   december 19 , 2000
inside washington   federal affairs
* * * ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural reforms * * *
at a special meeting friday afternoon , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly
awaited final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the
major outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to
california the responsibility for addressing state - related matters . at the
same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well
as the imposition of region - wide price caps . ferc reiterated their earlier
conclusions that under certain circumstances , california ratepayers were
subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california ' s
"" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight
demand and supply conditions throughout the west .
ferc adopted the november proposal to eliminate , effective immediately , the
state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities buy
and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to purchase
electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to
manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules effective at
the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman james
hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california
wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning
ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public
utilities commission ( cpuc ) .
the agency also modified the effective period of the $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""
proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a
"" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which
incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be
in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next
year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can
be place by the may 1 , deadline .
* * * energy secretary issues order to power generators and marketers to bolster
california ' s supplies * * *
energy secretary bill richardson has responded to the severely constrained
power supply situation in california by issuing an order , pursuant to section
202 ( c ) of the federal power act , to require generators and marketers to make
power available to meet the state ' s electricity needs . the emergency
directive requires that , if the california independent system operator ( iso )
certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity , certain
suppliers would be required to make power available to the iso if they have
power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm
customers . those suppliers that have provided power to the california power
exchange ( px ) and the iso over the last 30 days that have firm capacity
available would be subject to the order .
under the order , the iso is required to provide notice to each supplier
subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9 : 00 pm
est on the day before the requested service . the iso must , to the extent
feasible , allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each
supplier ' s available power . the price for the power provided pursuant to the
order will be set by an agreement between the iso and the supplier . if no
agreement is reached , ferc is to determine the just and reasonable rate at a
later date . the order will remain in effect until 3 : 00 am est on december
21 , 2000 unless modified .
* * * epa sets plans to regulate plants ' mercury emissions * * *
epa administrator carol browner , in a long - awaited announcement , indicated
last week that the administration will require reductions of mercury
emissions from coal - and oil - fired power plants . the agency stated that it
plans to propose new regulations in december 2003 , and hopes to finalize new
rules by december 2004 .
in the wake of the decision , eei called on epa to make certain that any
program to control utilities ' mercury emissions be based on the best
scientific information available in order to assure the protection of public
health . "" eei urges epa to maintain its commitment to resolving the key
scientific and technological issues , "" said paul bailey , eei vice president ,
environmental affairs . given these uncertainties , eei is disappointed that
the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health
threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science , "" said mr . bailey .
"" in the meantime , the electric power industry will continue to work with all
stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions
from power plants may be needed , and how those cuts should be achieved , "" mr .
bailey concluded .
mergers & acquisitions
* * * calpine completes acquisition of emi power assets * * *
calpine corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of
power assets from energy management , inc . ( emi ) . in the deal , calpine
acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed , combined - cycle
power generating facilities located in new england , as well as a joint
marketing venture between calpine and emi . prior to the transaction , calpine
held a 50 percent net interest in the projects .
"" we are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and
highly efficient power plants . the dighton , tiverton , and rumford facilities
were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in
new england , "" said calpine senior vice president bob alff . "" combined with
our other announced project in the northeast , we have created a coordinated
system of low - cost assets , with excellent geographic diversity , to provide
power to a very attractive new england market , "" added alff .
* * * exelon completes acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of sithe * * *
exelon corporation and sithe energies have announced the completion of
exelon ' s acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of the stock of sithe . the completion
of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which peco energy company agreed
to purchase 49 . 9 percent of sithe ' s assets in north america for $ 682
million . peco has since merged with unicom corporation to form exelon
corporation .
under the terms of the agreement , exelon has the option to purchase the
remaining 50 . 1 percent of sithe within two to five years at a price based on
prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised . exelon
and sithe will continue to operate independently , said the companies .
energy data
* * * weekly electric output ( week 50 ) * * *
electric output reached 74 , 737 gwh for the week ending december 9 ( week 50 ) ,

please note that i have re - formatted the attachment to an excel spreadsheet .
try the attachment and let me know if you have any problems . also , in
discussion with duke , txu fuel co . does not have a transportation agreement
with
duke for the redelivery of this gas . the agreement is between enron and duke .
according to brian kerns of duke , they basically took assignment of the
existing
transportation agreement enron had with pg & e ( now el paso ) . if this is the
case , then we should be using the nominated amount as the driver towards
meeting
our monthly minimum purchase obligation . any imbalance between enron and duke
on the duke system receipts would be transparent to txu and worked out between
enron and duke . any imbalance between the nominated volumed and the actual
volumes received at the "" teco tap "" would need to be worked out between enron
and
txu fuel co . there are a couple of different ways to work this out , but i
need
to review the contract first . please look at this on your side and lets come
to
an agreement as soon as possible since the end of the month is quickly
approaching .
thanks ,

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of "" excess "" gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

"Subject: re : default rates
mark , this is a good point . in moody ' s june 1999 study , debt recoveries for
corporate bankruptcies , there is a graph of firm - level recovery rates by year
of bankruptcy resolution ( as opposed to default year ) . reading from the
graph finds :
as the data above is based on resolution year , the same study finds the
average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1 . 30 years ( median 1 . 15 years
and standard deviation of 1 . 20 years ) . the interesting point is the slide in
recovery value 1996 to 1998 . one would wonder if the mix of high - yield
issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries
( quick technological obsolescence - - little tangible recovery value ) .
interesting to note is the december 1999 to december 2000 change in spreads .
the table below divides the december 2000 spreads by the december 1999
spreads . one would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this
time - frame , but the figures are more mixed :

subject : default rates
please see below for my note to jeremy at the bottom and his reponse . i
have placed mark ruane ' s yields against a mid november default frequency
table . note there may be a slight shearing in dates , but the concept is
more important :
market implied cumulative default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 51 5 . 74 14 . 54
aa 0 . 67 6 . 39 16 . 61
a 0 . 98 8 . 98 21 . 03
bbb 1 . 17 9 . 88 22 . 39
bb 3 . 27 18 . 62 37 . 51
b 4 . 65 24 . 21 46 . 27
s & p historical default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 00 0 . 13 0 . 67
aa 0 . 01 0 . 33 0 . 90
a 0 . 04 0 . 47 1 . 48
bbb 0 . 21 1 . 81 3 . 63
bb 0 . 91 8 . 82 14 . 42
b 5 . 16 20 . 95 27 . 13
in looking at the one - year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how
many more defaults occur in a recession ( 1991 ) versus average ( 1981 - 1999 )
historical default rates ( % ) :
investment grade non - investment
grade
avg . 1981 - 99 0 . 07 4 . 21
1991
0 . 12 10 . 40
multiple 1 . 7 x
2 . 5 x
looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals
default rates to obtain a "" multiple "" ( how much more severe than historical ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa infinite 44 . 2 x 21 . 7 x
aa 67 . 0 x 19 . 4 x 18 . 5 x
a 24 . 5 x 19 . 1 x 14 . 2 x
bbb 5 . 6 x 5 . 5 x 6 . 2 x
bb 3 . 6 x 2 . 1 x 2 . 6 x
b 1 . 1 x 1 . 2 x 1 . 7 x
on the 10 year historical figures , we need to be careful as the s & p static
pool figures show a definite seasoning ( lower defaults in late years probably
due to prepayment ) versus our contracts . secondly , the s & p figures have
withdrawn ratings , which usually mean they are stale , but loosing some
information content .
i will ask emy to set up a meeting to discuss further .

thanks . i would strongly suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful
of the right people so that we can step back and design the right
architecture for looking at credit in our deals . it is broken , not clear ,
killing our velocity and true capabilities . we also need to look at staffing ,
skills sets , the credit reserve model etc . perhaps you should take a crack at
an agenda .

strictly confidential .
i am pleased to introduce myself to you . my name is mr . wilson kamela a native of south africa and a senior employee of mines and natural resources department currently on a trainning course in holland for few months .
i am writing this letter to request your assistance in order to redeem an investment with the south african mining corporation . the said investment , now valued at ( $ 15 . 5 million dollars ) fifteen million , five hundred thousand dollars only was purchased by lucio harper and contracted out to the south african mining corporation in 1977 now recognised as mines and natural resources department . this redeemable investment interest , has now matured since march last year .
since march last year , several attempts have been made to contact lucio harper without success and there is no way to contact any of his close relatives in whose favour the investment cash value can be paid .
since we have access to all lucio harper ' s information , we can claim this money with the help of my partners with the south african mines and natural resources department . all we have to do is to file claim using you as lucio harper ' s relative .
i will like to assure you that there is absolutely nothing to worry about , because it is perfectly safe with no risk involved . please ensure to keep this matter strictly confidential . my partner will file a claim for this money on your behalf from the southafrican mining corporation . when the claim is approved , you as the beneficiary
will be paid ( 25 % ) of the total amouth .
since this money can be paid directly into any bank account of your choice , you have responsibility to ensure that my partner and ireceive ( 70 % ) of the total amouth . while the balance ( 5 % ) will be set aside for any unforseen expenses in the cause of transfering this money .
i will appreciate if you can give your assurance and guarantee that our share will be well secured . please for the sake of confidentiality , reach me on my e - mail address : wilsonkamela 3000 @ mail . com . please let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you . kindly reach me immediately with any of the stated contact addresses so that better clearifications
relating to the transaction will be explained to you .

"Subject: performance management process
as our existing businesses grow and new businesses are created , ease of
movement and development of our top talent becomes essential to our success .
as you heard at the management conference all officers will be titled ,
reviewed , promoted , and compensated according to a more standard set of
guidelines . the process recognizes the intrinsic value of each officer ,
rather than tying that individual to the value of their specific job or
reporting relationship .
officer titling has been standardized throughout enron . there are four
levels of officers : members of the enron office of the chairman make up level
4 . level 3 includes all other members of the enron executive committee .
level 2 is made up of managing directors , including company presidents and
some senior vice presidents . level 1 are vice presidents and some senior
vice presidents with grandfathered titles .
this year a common evaluation process is being implemented for level 1 and
level 2 officers . officers will be evaluated by a committee , through a
process referred to as the performance review committee ( prc ) , utilizing a
standard set of performance criteria and performance ratings . performance
committee reviews will occur twice a year  ) in july for feedback purposes and
at year - end for feedback as well as bonus and total compensation
considerations . the executive committee will handle the prc for all level 2
officers . review of level 1 officers will occur at the business - unit level
first with the results  & cross calibrated  8 by the executive committee and a
group of approximately sixteen managing directors .
the goals of the prc process is to insure a consistent standard for our
overall pool of executive talent and to provide a tool to more effectively
utilize talent throughout the organization . to further promote consistency
the executive committee will consider all promotions in january of each
year . exceptions , internally or externally , will be infrequent .
the individual  , s performance evaluation will be the starting point for all
compensation decisions . compensation includes base pay , bonus and long - term
awards . a long - term program that replaces individual or business unit plans
has been approved and will be communicated to individuals before bonus
payments are made .
in addition to the level 1 and level 2 reviews , business unit , global and
corporate cross - functional prc reviews for directors , senior directors and
general managers have started . this year - end process will be utilized as a
benchmark to determine how we further refine the evaluation process at this
level in the future .
if you should have any questions about the process , please direct them to
your human resources business unit leads per the following :

"Subject: next of kin
attn ; dear sir / madam .
i am mr . michael fisher , in charge of bills and foreign exchange remittance department of barclay ' s bank .
i am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co - operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department . we discovered an unclaimed sum of £ 24 . 5 million ( twenty - four million five hundred thousand british pounds sterling ) in an account belonging to one of our customer , who died in a car crash with the entire family in year 2001 .
since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money . unfortunately , neither the family nor the relation has appeared to claim this money . we cannot release this money unless somebody applies as the next of kin or relation to the deceased .
our banking guidelines indicated that if such money remained unclaimed for a period of four ( 4 ) years , it would be transferred into barclay ' s bank treasury as unclaimed fund . another officer and i in the department now decided to transfer this money into your account as the next of kin or relation of the deceased for easy collection since nobody is coming for it and we don ' t want this money to go back into the bank treasury as the unclaimed debt . in fact it is my friend that advised me to urgently arrange to transfer out this money through another foreign beneficiary outside the country .
we have decided to give you 20 % of the total sum . so please , as a matter of urgency send to me your telephone and fax numbers for effective communication . i will do my best to see that we conclude this transaction successfully on time .
please if you are interested send me an immediate mail so that i can explain the details to you , so you could understand everything about this business waiting for your urgent response .
thank you .

"Subject: just fyi
vince ,
please see below some of the ideas being bounced , fyi . please keep this
confidential .
the unused capacity in maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis ,
on behalf of mseb to any customers outside mseb ' s current purview . i would
like us to look at the whole issue as one of mseb ' s poor credit , and hence (
as jeff pointed out on the call ) , one where we need to identify all deep
pockets in and out of maharashtra .
secondly , there is ( as shubh and i had pointed out ) the ability to evacuate
about 700 - 1000 mw to customers other than mseb . the challege is - at what
price , and in coordination with which agencies . as always , in india your
greatest challenge will be in dealing with govt . agencies .
another point to consider is that in - all we have about 5 - 7 customers
identified . will all the customers we have earmarked bite ? ? ? this is the
reason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10 - 15
day power on the screens of the different sebs we can connect up with . this
also substantially gets around the credit quality issue , as this would be an
arrangement akin to cash - and - carry . i see a lot of hope for such a
strategy . i do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of power
to either ntpc or ptc . i would agree however , that we not put all our eggs
in one basket , and hence you could designate a team to look into the ntpc
sale issue inparallel .
in order to set up the trading sytems , however , we need to start by the end
of ql 2001 , and just start doing small deals where we break even , simply to
test the waters and introduce liquidity into the market .
hand - in - hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy , as i have
been pushing for . for this to happen , we need to get the special import
licence reinstated . if that is not possible , we need to lobby with the
highest authorities within govt . and rbi to allow for hedging , irrespective
of whether we have an sil . the discussions being held with ioc are therefore
very important in this regard , and i am going to get anshuman and mukesh
involved with the same .
finally , i do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ene management
for $ 75 million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatory
framework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than the
generation side of the equation . i would refrain from stating this in any
senior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate the
cost - benefit of this . i have some ideas on that side which i need to develop
further .

sandeep .",0

subject : hello from chicago
hey guys , i just wanted to update everybody on what ' s going on up here in
chicago . we ' ve finally got our computers hooked up , so we are off and
running now . actually , we got quite of few projects going on up here ( yes ,
these are real projects ) and we are going to need the houston structuring
group for support . i don ' t know if you guys are still short - handed and what
kind of projects you may already have lined - up , but i wanted list out some of
the projects that we are currently working on .
gas
lrg project - deirde is currently working on this with russell
nss storage - sean boyle helped value both their current and new nss . we are
currently working on negotiating with people ' s for these , and i expect that
there may be additional requests in the future .
manlove summer withdraw program - yes this is not a typo . surprise ,
surprise . . . manlove can do a lot more than we thought . i ' ve talked to
deirdre about it and created a simple model , but i would like to better
analyze this with your help .
capital improvements - we ' ve got people ' s christmas list of capital projects
that we are going to help them analyze and seek if any of these make sense .
sendout model - we would like to help them better optimize their morning
sendout taking into account current market pricing and the enron supply deal .
pbr - we are not sure when or if people ' s will file a pbr , but i think that
there are a lot of things that we learned during our previous experience that
we can do to help them prepare for a competitive marketplace ( ie transport
customers tariff restructuring )
pesc - people ' s is looking for assistance in understanding load following and
helping them build models to optimize their retail gas effort
san juan pricing - evan has been working with the desk to provide indicative
pricing with regard to pec hedging out some of their san juan production
reserves
power
power project development - we have several power projects underway and the
ctg group ( billy lemmons ) is helping us create necessary models
pesc - the retail power stuff lives . i ' ve think that fallon has a new
attitude on these deals and enron has committed to help them figure out this
market .
power plant balancing model - we have in our portfolio and will be offering
balancing / storage services for chicago area power projects . we would like to
have a model or at least a better understanding to help us with this endeavor .
we have resources in chicago dedicated to these projects , as well as the
other stuff we ' re trying to do like negotiate contracts and set up the
chicago back office function . we plan on adding our own structuring
resources ( in chicago or houston ) , but we felt that we ought to start by
figuring out what support the houston office will be able to provide . i will
be in the office this monday ( jan 17 ) , so i hope to be able to catch up with
you and discuss some of these items then . feel free to contact me if you
need to before then at 312 . 357 . 8876 or pager 800 . 778 . 0291 . thanks

hello vasant !
bijoya has updated me on the discussion you have been having on the article
from risk magazine about credit .
we have found that the attachments you sent her are actually not
word - for - word the same as the published version we have - the changes are
only minor , wever , and have not altered the article in any way .
my question now concerns the copyrights . since the version you sent is
slightly different , do you think this gives us the freedom to publish it
without the consent of risk ?
and if not - can you tell me if it was published by risk uk or risk in the
states ? and which issue was it ? i just want to have all of the details if i
need to call someone at the magazine . . .
also - was there a lawyer involved in the publication procedure , or was this
handled by london / houston pr ? or by vince himself ?
sorry about all of the questions . . . i just want to avoid problems well in
advance .

vince / vasant ,
it has been some time since we spoke at the san antonio conference .
unfortunately , as soon as i got to india i was diagnosed wih a slip disc and
had to be in bed for a long time .
in the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to
another state out of the dabhol plant . i have developed the concept whereby
we are now looking at a firm component ( over peak period ) , and an infirm
power sale during the monsoon .
the series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below
should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal . i am currently in
houston and reachable at 281 - 345 - 9870 . i maybe needing a surgery for the
slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won ' t be needed .
i would like to wis you all a very happy x ' mas and a great new year , and will
catch you in the new year in houston to discuss this wit you further . i can
see that soem structuring help will be needed on this , and would like to get
some help from your end .

"Subject: new volatility curve generator for uk power
we have established a set of power volatility curves down to the efa / monthly
level of detail that can be marked to market up to 6 years out . beyond this ,
the volatility decays to what we understand to be the long - term level for
power volatility , given our understanding of the behaviour of forward prices
over large time - scales .
the swaption traders can now fit the first 5 - 6 years of the volatility curve
to the market - observed baseload swaption implied volatilities ( typically 3 to
12 months duration for the underlying swap ) and then be in a good position to
price other swaptions ( including swaptions on individual efa slots )
consistent with the curve . there may also be an impact on the daily var
calculation .
an illustration of the current volatility curves is pasted below : -
these curves will be reset as the market moves , and allow a mark - to - market
approach to be followed for our volatility book . the spreadsheet model is
saved in t : \ readwrte \ elec _ uk \ models \ . xls and also
attached below for houston staff to review .

"Subject: marketing services / scheduling
daren ,
thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling
the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a
strong case could be made in favor of that idea .
it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing ,
nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge
base and the responsibility factor . it is a "" who ' s on first "" issue .
if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market
intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the
schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and
pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services
immensely .
as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and
more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes
they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture .
i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to
handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to
think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only
person that should be involved in the industrials .
i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you
and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat
that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite
alright .
once again , thanks for listening .

to incorporate the real option valuation approach into the model enabling us

the quality of included studies was poor overall we did not detect bias

shift the results for studies comparing the same lactam relative risk 1 02

subject : stephen bennett
stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research
group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment
criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a
senior specialist .
after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an
"" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of
a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of
this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""
at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron
designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar
hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,
who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while
functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job
classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional
professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the
proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist
category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected
at this time .
although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work
experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the
weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in
atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,
needing no further training and only minimal supervision .
once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron
values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather
briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation
as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .
stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he
designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather
derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and
liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion
and major upgrade of this web page .
these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,
to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the
advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily
on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his
supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do
not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations
assistance .
in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was
enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a
meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional
title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving
of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

subject : rollover of my vacation days to 2001
vince :
i would like to rollover my vacation days for 2000 remaining at the end of
this year to 2001 . i could not use us all of my available vacation this year
because of the following reasons :
1 . as you know , i have been supporting three business units ( ees , epg & enron
india ) this year . all these units had difficult and relatively long projects
that required experience in energy markets , derivatives pricing and business
knowledge that i had gained over the last few years at enron .
2 . there has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me . i
now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year .
of the current six members , five joined us only this year and most of them
didn ' t have any prior work experience , thus requiring a lot of my time in
recruiting , training and mentoring .
3 . given that i had to visit our bombay office in january , 2000 for a
business trip ( 10 days ) and will need to go there again in january , 2001 , i
could not take leave from my work for the other two units ( ees & epg ) for an
extended period of time .
so , in summary , this year has been a long and challenging one , and as a
result , i could not take vacation for more than a few days . i request you to
grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year .
currently i have 136 hours of vacation available and , of these , i expect to
have 112 hours unused at the end of this year .
thank you ,

i spoke with roy kass of the energy information agency this morning . apart
from clarifying the timeliness , or lack thereof , of the published
state - specific wellhead production estimates , he indicates their scientists
find severe weather in the fields ( freezes , hurricanes ) to be a far more
significant issue in production , and in wellhead prices , than is severe
weather in the northeast , for instance . also , he agrees with you as to there
being strictly increasing marginal costs in production , there being a rich

reply destinyl 21212121 @ netscape . net
i am mr . srichai pope , credit officer of win hang bank ltd . i have an urgent and
very
confidential business proposition for you .
on august 6 , 1999 , a british consultant / contractor with the chinese solid minerals
corporation , mr . philip brian a british citizen made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit
for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 38 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty - eight million
dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent aroutine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply .
after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract
employers , the hong kong solid minerals corporation that mr . philip brian died from
a boat mishap . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a
will , and all attempts totrace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made
further investigation and discovered that mr . philip brian did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my
bank . this sum of us $ 38 , 000 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is
being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever
come forward to claim it . according to laws of hong kong , at the expiration of 5
( five ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the hong kong
government if nobody applies to claim the fund .
consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the
next of kin to mr . philip brian so that the fruits of this old man ' s labor will not get
into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is simple , i will like you to
provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare
the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of
kin .
the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65 % for me
and 30 % for you and 5 % for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction .
there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the
attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful
execution of this transaction .
if you are interested , please reply immediately to my e - mail
box . destinyl 21212121 @ netscape . net
upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction . please send me your
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication . you should
observe utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this transaction would be
most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my
share in your country . awaiting your urgent reply .
sincerely

daren ,
we are working with mark mccoy on getting some things repathed in the
system . it appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in unify
just the deliveries - not sure why ? ? ? ? . we have been paying the suppliers
based on whatever they invoice us for , which typically has been a smaller
number than what we have in unify . also , we have not been able to get a
contact for the allocation statement . in some cases , we get the summary
sheet , but no detail and some months we don ' t get anything at all . do you
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on
a timely and consistent basis ? the contacts on the allocation statements
that we do have are not returning phone calls . i also need to know what was
the beginning balance when we took this on for tenaska ? anything else that
we need from you , i will call you .

"Subject: re : meter 5892
daren :
sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue , i am with ees now .
karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while i was in transition .
exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis .
december 2000
the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this
e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at
this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will
show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine .
january 2001
again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu
flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other
deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get
this issue resolved .
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024
contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue .

"Subject: unresolved issues for jan 1 .
i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments
and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current
issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of
these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought
you two might want to dicsuss these issues .
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know .
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated .
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ?
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to
the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned
issues .
hank eisenhours duties were split :
mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,
december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .
carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all
offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey
also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas
for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .
hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .
hpl operational seems to be left unassigned .
i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks
responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .",0

subject : reliant energy - entex transport imbalance
howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .

"Subject: default rates
please see below for my note to jeremy at the bottom and his reponse . i
have placed mark ruane ' s yields against a mid november default frequency
table . note there may be a slight shearing in dates , but the concept is
more important :
market implied cumulative default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 51 5 . 74 14 . 54
aa 0 . 67 6 . 39 16 . 61
a 0 . 98 8 . 98 21 . 03
bbb 1 . 17 9 . 88 22 . 39
bb 3 . 27 18 . 62 37 . 51
b 4 . 65 24 . 21 46 . 27
s & p historical default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 00 0 . 13 0 . 67
aa 0 . 01 0 . 33 0 . 90
a 0 . 04 0 . 47 1 . 48
bbb 0 . 21 1 . 81 3 . 63
bb 0 . 91 8 . 82 14 . 42
b 5 . 16 20 . 95 27 . 13
in looking at the one - year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how
many more defaults occur in a recession ( 1991 ) versus average ( 1981 - 1999 )
historical default rates ( % ) :
investment grade non - investment
grade
avg . 1981 - 99 0 . 07 4 . 21
1991
0 . 12 10 . 40
multiple 1 . 7 x
2 . 5 x
looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals
default rates to obtain a "" multiple "" ( how much more severe than historical ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa infinite 44 . 2 x 21 . 7 x
aa 67 . 0 x 19 . 4 x 18 . 5 x
a 24 . 5 x 19 . 1 x 14 . 2 x
bbb 5 . 6 x 5 . 5 x 6 . 2 x
bb 3 . 6 x 2 . 1 x 2 . 6 x
b 1 . 1 x 1 . 2 x 1 . 7 x
on the 10 year historical figures , we need to be careful as the s & p static
pool figures show a definite seasoning ( lower defaults in late years probably
due to prepayment ) versus our contracts . secondly , the s & p figures have
withdrawn ratings , which usually mean they are stale , but loosing some
information content .
i will ask emy to set up a meeting to discuss further .

thanks . i would strongly suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful
of the right people so that we can step back and design the right
architecture for looking at credit in our deals . it is broken , not clear ,
killing our velocity and true capabilities . we also need to look at staffing ,

subject : my resume
vasant ,
i enjoyed our telephone conversation this morning . from our conversation ,
it sounds like enron is moving out on the cutting edge of risk transfer and
insurance finance . in my mind , there seem to be a myriad number of
interesting opportunities moving forward . as well , i see a number of issues
that would need to be resolved . frankly , i find that quite exciting . i
left academics largely because i wanted to move into a more "" front line ""
career . while i ' ve enjoyed my work here at the naic , it is still not where i
ultimately see myself . i gathered from your comments some concern about my
being too senior in the organization . if i am interpreting you correctly ,
you are concerned about hands on technical work . i enjoy that immensely and
some of the strengths i bring to the table are the ability to think
creatively about solving financial problems and the the ability to make data
tell the underlying story .
i look forward to talking to you next week . i just found out that our
office building will be closed monday , so i will not be in until tuesday

subject : unresolved issues for jan 1 . - followup
here is a followup to the memo sent on 12 / 31 / 99 . fyi
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know . unresolved - appears to be unassigned ?
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . unresolved
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . unresolved
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january . resolved but needs to be verified .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated . unresolved or unpathed ?
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? unresolved
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
i haven ' t had time to do this yet . if we haven ' t figured out the assignement
then i will get to it asap .",0

here ' s the response i got with regards to tomcat . i ' ve place another call
into david and let him know that the information we received included most
points except for tomcat . i ' ll keep you informed .
what i know is that the gas is sourced at mi 587 and moved on km ' s firm
contract . for as long as ces remembers , they sell the gas to entex . entex
chooses the pipe off which they take - - usually midcon - - also , hpl channel , or
tejas . km is invoiced directly . volume is approx . 2395 . the deal with entex
is written up monthly . km pays on a basket of indices . entex pays on the

susan ,
hope you had a great new year and holiday season ! i have a couple of issues
i want ot clear up for this year ' s contract .
the question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you
are currently pulling gas . our new contract that was just sent to you has a
minimum take of 60 , 000 mmbtu ( estimated 35 , 000 @ 8018 celanese , 15 , 000 @ 1233
texas city , and 10 , 000 @ 1394 dodge street ) . if you undertake at any meter
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60 , 000
mmbtu . my accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out . we discussed
this on the phone and i got your consent to split these invoices . now we are
being told all three invoices need to be separate . since we always aim to
please the customer , here is my recommendation for handling the contract
through it ' s term . please let me know if this is fine .
celanese 35 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
35 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
texas city 15 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
15 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
dodge street 10 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below

refurbs save cash ! why hesitate getting the best
value by getting the exact same equipment , with original
manufacturers warranty at a much lower price .
q :
what
is considered factory refurbished ?
a : there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as "" new "" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few
examples :
manufacturers /
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /
country .
to avoid
"" disturbing "" the dealer / reseller channel in different
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb .
most major retail
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,
inspected and repackaged like new .
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the
manufacturer .
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested
and then repackaged just like new .
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected .
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are
inspected , tested and repackaged .
the box was simply
opened . thats it !
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .
all factory
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product
specifications . all
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer

cera alert : december 13 , 2000
title : california on the brink
cera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas
california on the brink
the california stalemate
california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over
credit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would
avoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california ' s utilities , the
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address
the situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .
western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this
summer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis ,
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and
significant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied
the requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end
their rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance
the costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .
the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to
address the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective
solution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain
muddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is
possible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail
to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .
in the six months since california ' s supply shortfall began plaguing western
markets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .
rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and
demand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed ,
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by
discouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated
changes to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a
challenging siting and permitting process .
medicine worse than the illness
several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of
california ' s electric market woes . *
* challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power
plant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone
has struck down some key proposed facilities .
* price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices
limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .
* repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including
the price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new
plant development .
* calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the
ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the
california markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of
gaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits
are a threat to new plant development .
* facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .
cera ' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west
are not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of
older units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .
california ' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers
considering entering the state .
despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in
the state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .
in addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the
earliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk
of an outage .
the road to recovery
there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity
shortfall :
* encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal
some have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these
actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?
* stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new
build .
* move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the
pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence
( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in
the state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with
the market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move
toward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a
series of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if
they end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect
of knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments .
* encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although
originally a feature of california ' s market design , most consumers are
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a
demand response .
* encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "" boom bust "" characteristic of
the market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement ,
or a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to
elicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate )
future price volatility .
* avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to
be restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term
contractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the
market structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since
july - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to
do its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its
course .
* allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to
emissions restrictions .
* free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa
power plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from
operating to generate only power .

"Subject: vince and vasant :
here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany , capacity trader at
the east desk , related to gas transmission :
typically , pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis . an example
might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn , where you might pay
$ 12 . 00 per month per 10 , 000 decatherms of capacity ( $ 0 . 40 per day ) , a fixed
payment . variable charges are 6 % for fuel costs ( "" shrinkage "" ) and 6 . 5 % for
overhead expenses . a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of nymex - $ 0 . 10 ( "" basis "" ) , and might call brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of nymex + $ 0 . 25 . the trader ' s spread is
$ 0 . 35 , and variable costs of transmission are $ 0 . 125 , so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $ 0 . 225 for firm capacity tomorrow .
as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible , the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm - equivalent of interruptible capacity .
also , many pipelines don ' t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
( "" it ' s not worth their time to haggle "" ) ( there is a further issue of
"" secondary markets "" not important to the model yet ) . for south texas and
brooklyn , there are several different routes the gas can physically take
( pipelines of enron , texas eastern , etc ) . and , once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the ( enron ) positions on each end of the pipeline ,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts .

"Subject: personal contact
dear sir / madam ,
you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker .
before the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland .
the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father .
it is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers .
i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice .
i have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end .
you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction .
thank for your anticipated co - operations .
peter stevens .

"Subject: 2000 plan allocations and january allocations
please read brian ' s memo below . we spoke briefly about this yesterday in the
staff meeting . i have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where i
have provide the 2000 plan allocations . please note that we were not making
changes to the plan , only breaking the gas asset group into smaller buckets .
any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are not
reflected on the allocation sheet . rather they are reflected on the 1 / 00
allocations , and they will require explanations each month as all variances
from plan do . this includes new rc ' s which have set up , etc .
i need each of you to review the 2000 plan allocations as i submitted them
earlier today , and provide an accurate allocation of your rc for 1 / 00 . what
has your group spent their time on in 1 / 00 ? ? ? please be aware that we could
receive questions from the commercial teams , so document your logic . some
things to consider :
project sally - allocate to gas network development
project hurricane - allocate to ? ? ? ? - ( i have a call into jim coffey )
denver business - allocate to rocky mountain asset originations
if you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them ,
either call me , jackie nelson or jim coffey .
one other thing to note : the network trading group will be further broken
down into 2 groups : trading ( tom martin and jim schwieger ) and
transportation ( ed gottlob ) . although the attached worksheet does not
include this breakdown , please include it in yours .
i would like you allocations back to me no later than thursday , 1 / 20 @

subject : 2000 plan allocations and january allocations
the attached files contain the allocation percentages for 2000 plan , january
2000 actuals and a description of the new assets teams .
please update the 2000 plan file to reflect the following changes to the
assets team . the assets team is now broken out into the following "" groups ""
which are described in the attached word document :
rc # team name rc owner
the 2000 plan file now has columns for the above teams , please take the
percentage that was previously allocatated to assets ( which is in the
executive column ) and reallocate it among all of the teams except rocky
mountain asset originations that you support . i have already inserted the
new percentages to be used for rocky mountain , which are based on a portion
of the upstream origination allocation that was determined by the assets
group . consequently i have changed the allocation percentage for upstream
origination . i have also protected all of the cells except the ones you need
to change to avoid confusion .
i also need you to update the percentages to be used for january 2000
actuals . i have added the new rc ' s that we have set up since plan has been
complete , so please make sure you have each rc 100 % allocated .
i will need the updated plan percentages returned to me by noon wednesday
january 19 th , and the updated january 2000 percentages returned to me by end
of day friday january 21 st .
thanks for your help in getting these updated .

"Subject: joao neves
dear vince :
?
i am in a somewhat delicate position . one of the people in the group here
has asked me to introduce him to you . ? as an el paso vice president , i
should not have agreed to do this , and frankly , the guy should not have
asked . ? but he is clearly very unhappy at el paso , so , as a human being , i
felt it was appropriate . also , because this guy would have contacted you
anyway , with or without my introduction , as a professional courtesy , i would
like you to benefit from my experience with this fellow .
?
the guy ' s name is joao neves ( portugese ) . ? i think he is reasonably bright
and seems to have a quite deep understanding of general finance and
financial mathematics . he is a manager and feels very frustrated because he
had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority . instead the group ' s
m . d . brought in two price - waterhouse - coopers consultants as v . p ' s to run the
structuring and quant sides of the group . in this respect , i can understand
his unhappiness . unfortunately for him , however , i also think it is in his
nature to whine . ? i have observed him to bad mouth lots of people starting
with the it guys ( ok , that ' s perhaps not much an indictment ! ) all the way to
dismissing broadie & glasserman ' s or eduardo schwartz ' works as shoddy or
shallow . ? he does not seem to suffer well people he considers fools . ? caveat
emptor , therefore ! having said all this , i do want to emphasize that he is a
bright guy , is very pleasant with me , and , perhaps given the appropriate
environment and supervision , might be quite productive . ? but don ' t take my
word for it . talk to him , and see what you think . ? obviously , i would ask
that you keep these comments in confidence . i have given you an honest
assessment - - brutally so .
?
' nuff said ! i have fulfilled my moral obligations both to joao and to you .

greetings ,
i am prince fayad w . bolkiah , the eldest son of prince jefri bolkiah , former finance minister of brunei , the tiny oil - rich sultanate on the northern coast of the island of borneo , in eastern asia . i will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history , which has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother , the sultan of brunei sheik muda hassanal bolkiah .
as you may know from the international media , the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of us $ 14 . 8 billion dollars . this was as a result of the asian financial crisis that made my father company amedeo development company and government owned brunei investment company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office . however my father was kept under house arrest , his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the sultanate .
furthermore , during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives , but before i could do that i was placed under house arrest by the sultan and i have no access to a phone but i have a palm v hand - held computer from which i am sending you this mail . before my incaceration , i went ahead to dispatch the sum of fifty eight million five hundred thousand united states dollars us $ 58 . 5 million in cash under special arrangement into the custody of a private security and trustee company for safe keeping abroad .
hence i seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family abroad . i have decided to offer 10 % of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation .
please i count on your absolute confidentiality , transparency and trust while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of this business transaction .
i remain yours sincerely .

to : enron north america corp .
from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon
in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the
continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our
people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,
and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both
within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the
corporate goal of fostering 
b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers
including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and
mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,
textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream
coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .
downstream coverage / origination
as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both
ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron
corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function
will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy
commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities
but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,
plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels
groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper
will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s
leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three
sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :
a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage
activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for
the provision of innovative
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision
of paper risk management products ;
b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to
lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the
chemicals and refined products industries ;
c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers
trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the
coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,
heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles
and glass manufacturing industries .
midstream coverage / origination
a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on
energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas
utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern
interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this
group ;
b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on
energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas
utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they
will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring
opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the
leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from
calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;
c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on
the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant
power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked
mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will
continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern
interconnect ;
d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring
opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing
restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have
asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,
formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of
citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join
this newly formed business .
2 ) commercial transactions :
the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff
donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of
transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing
transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity
of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction
development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity
structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical
analysis and upstream asset management .
the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction
with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service
and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :
a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and
western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group
include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy
lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of
capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today
from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power
origination .
b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial
origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,
environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is
established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay
boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .
c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant
services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior
members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and
john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the
vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few
weeks .
d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer
finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include
brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition
of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .
ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and
downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary
responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will
continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior
commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual
responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the
capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain
largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction
development teams and their respective origination groups will be located
together .
we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage
and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial
markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between
the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .
please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north
america by working with us to implement these changes .",0

subject : project hurricane / bridgeline status
here is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v .
between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline
pipeline systems :
summary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the
name of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %
enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading
on the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in
the process of being drafted .
enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to
support this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand
that accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps
scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st
floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen
center once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv
will start in early february for march production .
to do ' s :
accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it
transition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next
monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same
page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .
pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my
request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .
networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the
voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot
is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a
combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been
requested .
location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from
facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .
currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall
cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall
cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .
data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and
meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin
trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump
of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .
we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need
to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the
system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know
who else will need access .
interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada
application : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright
from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two
applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .
there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s
rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime
there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything
is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between
pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is
complete .
scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to
enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to
them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs
by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best
done as a part of the scada transition .
accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be
better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this
process started .
hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be
billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk
through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least
initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the
billing for this one customer .
please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have
my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached
at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy",0

i would like to request for a new pc . my current pc is quite old with not

i ran out of memory and had to have it people coming to clean it for me .
their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new pc . given that dell has pentiumc iii
processor at 800 mhz
on market , i would like to request a pc with process at 500 mhz or higher
level .
thank you very much .

"Subject: news : aurora 5 . 2 update
aurora version 5 . 2
- the fastest model just got faster -
epis announces the release of aurora , version 5 . 2
aurora the electric market price forecasting tool is already
legendary for power and speed . we ' ve combined a powerful chronological
dispatch model with the capability to simulate the market from 1
day to 25 + years . add to that a risk analysis section , powered by user
selectable monte carlo & / or latin hypercube modeling , enough
portfolio analysis power to please the toughest critic , & inputs and
outputs from standard excel & access tables and you ' ve got one of most
powerful tools in the market .
just a few months ago we expanded our emissions modeling
capabilities , added our quarterly database update , increased the speed
of the entire model , and made
but that wasn ' t enough .
we ' ve done it again . some of the operations that we ' ve
included . . .
two new reporting enhancements .
the first is marginal reporting
for fuels , resources and groups of resources .
the second is the ability to
display resource stack information in graphical and dispatch order form .
other enhancements include dual fuel modeling , improved
transmission modeling , greater access to hourly results , and the ability
to model monthly emission rates . moreover , the databases for
central and eastern , texas , and western markets have been updated to use
the new modeling capabilities .
we continue to make aurora easier to use . this version enhances
user control over modeling , editing inputs , and viewing of aurora
output . clients desiring to exploit the power of aurora now have
greater control over the inputs and outputs through vb scripting in
aurora . the new "" update data "" capability provides a means to
universally change any data element .
attached is more information on the fastest and most flexible
tool of its kind .
for additional information , please visit our website ( www . epis . com ) or

cc :
subject : default rates
please see below for my note to jeremy at the bottom and his reponse . i
have placed mark ruane ' s yields against a mid november default frequency
table . note there may be a slight shearing in dates , but the concept is
more important :
market implied cumulative default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 51 5 . 74 14 . 54
aa 0 . 67 6 . 39 16 . 61
a 0 . 98 8 . 98 21 . 03
bbb 1 . 17 9 . 88 22 . 39
bb 3 . 27 18 . 62 37 . 51
b 4 . 65 24 . 21 46 . 27
s & p historical default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 00 0 . 13 0 . 67
aa 0 . 01 0 . 33 0 . 90
a 0 . 04 0 . 47 1 . 48
bbb 0 . 21 1 . 81 3 . 63
bb 0 . 91 8 . 82 14 . 42
b 5 . 16 20 . 95 27 . 13
in looking at the one - year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how
many more defaults occur in a recession ( 1991 ) versus average ( 1981 - 1999 )
historical default rates ( % ) :
investment grade non - investment
grade
avg . 1981 - 99 0 . 07 4 . 21
1991
0 . 12 10 . 40
multiple 1 . 7 x
2 . 5 x
looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals
default rates to obtain a "" multiple "" ( how much more severe than historical ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa infinite 44 . 2 x 21 . 7 x
aa 67 . 0 x 19 . 4 x 18 . 5 x
a 24 . 5 x 19 . 1 x 14 . 2 x
bbb 5 . 6 x 5 . 5 x 6 . 2 x
bb 3 . 6 x 2 . 1 x 2 . 6 x
b 1 . 1 x 1 . 2 x 1 . 7 x
on the 10 year historical figures , we need to be careful as the s & p static
pool figures show a definite seasoning ( lower defaults in late years probably
due to prepayment ) versus our contracts . secondly , the s & p figures have
withdrawn ratings , which usually mean they are stale , but loosing some
information content .
i will ask emy to set up a meeting to discuss further .

thanks . i would strongly suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful
of the right people so that we can step back and design the right
architecture for looking at credit in our deals . it is broken , not clear ,
killing our velocity and true capabilities . we also need to look at staffing ,
skills sets , the credit reserve model etc . perhaps you should take a crack at

vince , zimin ,
i participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning . there
was a possibility enron would invest in it .
their product appears to be a gui interface over the top of ilog solver ( and
possibly ilog cplex ) which allows problems to be expressed in high level
terms . i do not see any immediate application at enron , but i am interested
in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo . maybe it would be
useful for general modelling projects here .
they do not even have a user manual for their software , so it will be
difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged . the
possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ilog software is a
modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that
market . i think the scheduling tools in sap , i 2 , etc are more likely to
succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information
system .
because of the small market for this software , the many competitors , the
absence of any clear use for it at enron and the early stage of development ,
there is very little prospect of us funding this company .

"Subject: underpriced issue with high return on equity
the oil and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term bul | market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervaiued energy plays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us "" oil belt ""
and in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia | of millions per week .

emerson oil and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pleased to announce that the

company ' s we | | 11 - 16 - 24 - 2 the acadia project .
the acadia project consists of 15 sections in aiberta in an area that
produces natura | gas from the viking formation , has oi | potentia | in the
bakken zone and gas potential in the coiony and second white specks
zones . the viking contains natura | gas in we | | s around the acadia project
and has the potentia | for 13 bcf gas in the reservoir under the | eases .
gas weils in the area have caicuiated aof rates up to 14 mmcf per day .
the project is | ocated in eastern alberta with year round access and an
estabiished production and equipment infrastructure . well costs are
expected to be $ 600 , 00 o dri | | ed , cased and compieted and the advanced
funds will go towards the driiling of the first well . each weil on a | ease
earns emerson a 49 % working interest in one section .

price - . o 26
the vaiue of eogi ' s shares will skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul |
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripied in the | ast two years .
3 . with multipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi - mi | | ions , eogi is selling for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas speciaiizes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready
shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overall market .
in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the
past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized explorers and
developers | ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in
the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple
returns .
our subscribers need to pay particuiariy close attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company
with a comparably small market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oi |
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
the daiiy jump in energy prices .
but al | that wi | | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equa | | y expiosive effect on
the share price .
what wi | | the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in
the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or decline
slightiy , you will sti | | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings
will soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors will be
staggering .
overall , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares wi | | surge sharply on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are wel | established and are going into massive
production . eariy investors wil | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this area will reaily turn up the heat , causing us to revise our
targets upward in next week ' s builetin .

6 . is there a waskom nom form ? with whom do you speak over there ?
7 . for the avails sheet you sent , the first row of column titles is blacked
out . can you tell me what the row reads ?
8 . what volumes will come from koch gathering into carthage for next month ?
we show conflicting numbers .
thanks ,
ami
713 / 853 - 9272
here goes . . .
1 . i know tennessee , hpl , and tejas are at the tailgate of the plant , and i
suspect midcon texas is there as well .
2 . i ' ll fax you a copy of the nomination form that steve locke uses for agua
dulce and carthage . . . those are the only ones in texas that we nominate .
3 . the tejas plant as well as all of the other gulf energy receipt points
from
pennzenergy are exclusively tejas / gulf energy points , and it takes transport
charges to move the gas through gulf energy to interconnects , such as
thompsonville . the jennings plant does have a split connect with delhi , but
operationally pennzenergy much prefers to flow into gulf energy ( lower
pressure
= higher volumes ) .
4 . mustang island 759 for january is again 1 , 903 mmbtu / d , which peoples will
pick up at the wellhead . mustang island 785 is 4 , 100 / d , which leaves 2 , 200 / d
available to sell assuming we continue to transport 1 , 895 / d to fgt / tivoli for
peoples . our it agreement on nng is # 78581 to move gas from the wellhead to
onshore .
5 . the tomcat gas has been sold to entex into midcon texas for so long that i
don ' t think maria even talks to them anymore each month . tammi provides them
with the volume when she does the deal each month . but we can certainly
provide an entex contact if the gas is sold to them again in january .
6 . there isn ' t a waskom nomination form . the trader for this gas , mike
landolt , talks to ben britten ( president of new waskom gas gathering and
waskom
gas marketing ) .
7 . you must be referring to the page of offshore avails that begins with
sabine pass 13 . the 6 columns that appear blacked out read as follows : pvr ,
pvr , avail , dbq , dbq , and remainder .
8 . the koch - gathered volumes behind the carthage plant for 1 / 00 are 12 , 443
mmbtu / d .

subject : re : more questions
1 . at carthage , the deliveries to koch ? what is that 15000 on your
whiteboard for . who is it to ? are the volumes termed up ?
2 . at midcon texas , you usually sell all the supply to its marketing
affiliate , correct ? is so , is that gas termed up or do you sell it month to
month ?
3 . is the gas to entex off tomcat sold as base or swing ? don ' t they change
the volume occasionally ? has anadarko given you any avails for jan ?
round 2 :
1 . the 15 , 000 @ carthage for koch is an estimate of what we anticipate we
will
want to sell into koch . . . and it shows up on the koch whiteboard as a supply
( from carthage ) . during bidweek the traders will decide how much they
actually
want to show going to koch , and how much will be labeled base and swing . mike
landolt has been our sole koch trader and he typically takes some carthage gas
into koch , but i wouldn ' t say a particular volume is termed - up .
2 . other than very rarely shippling the jennings ranch volume over to ngpl ,
we ' ve always sold all of the midcon texas volumes to the affiliate . . .
currently done one month at a time . john hymel has been the trader for these
volumes .
3 . the entex sale @ tomcat has always been gas daily because that is the way
kerr - mcgee prices the supply . . . and entex has taken all the swings . the
january volume is 2 , 312 / d .

"Subject: alliance info alert : richardson and ferc orders
dear generation / power marketing executive :
the following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred
friday , december 15
1 . energy secretary richardson issuance of an emergency order .
( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s
web site at :
http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html )
2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets
( ferc ' s order can be viewed at
california supplies ordered by richardson
o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso
o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 ,
unless extended
o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later
o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977
as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill
richardson found "" an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage
of electric energy "" and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of
the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to
provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the
california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the
reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in
the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts .
the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it
has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing
requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to
the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm ,
eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order
directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among
subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power .
the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern
time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies
under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe
headquarters every 24 hours .
the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers
to the iso "" are to be agreed to by the parties . "" if no agreement is reached ,
then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson "" will
immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to
the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date
by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will
prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and
reasonable . "" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under
emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do
not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe
organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section
from ferc to doe .
the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities
that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities
are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and
transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by
the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . ""
[ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;
electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]
ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural
reforms
a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion
at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited
final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major
outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the
responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at
the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as
well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .
ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,
california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates
due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in
conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .
while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome
that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner
expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman
hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .
hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission
had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on
november 1 , as discussed below .
highlights of key actions :
( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,
the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities
buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to
purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative
mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules
effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman
hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california
wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning
ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public
utilities commission ( cpuc ) .
( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""
proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a
"" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which
incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be
in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next
year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can
be place by the may 1 , deadline .
in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that
while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues
written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under
review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .
as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from
setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above
$ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,
weekly basis and provide certain cost support .
( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of
independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing
board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to
the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures
for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .
( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for
assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will
be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of
pricing long - term contracts .
to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable
rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market
participants .
( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to
schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and
instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent
of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the
real - time spot market .
( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file
generation interconnection standards .
( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,
including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,
2001 .
( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board
selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and
negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .
( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to
resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability
of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand
responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of
sufficient reserve requirements .
commissioner responses
comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed
opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new
generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,
hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission
should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of
the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the
role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert
nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which
he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission
for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order
approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended
by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to
forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .
comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress
towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly
"" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,
calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also
concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will
be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of
the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the
$ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .
comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for
california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been
exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers
had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned
that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised
to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on
to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of
60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he
emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of
creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey
hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference
and that the market would have rules more like pjm .
finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done
differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not
enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the
on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,
preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he
would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and
that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,
he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .
chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced
to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is
now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by
shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the
long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the
least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a
regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the
fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the
public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .
however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to
address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california
situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not
fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0

subject : rollover of my vacation days to 2001
vince :
i would like to rollover my vacation days for 2000 remaining at the end of
this year to 2001 . i could not use us all of my available vacation this year
because of the following reasons :
1 . as you know , i have been supporting three business units ( ees , epg & enron
india ) this year . all these units had difficult and relatively long projects
that required experience in energy markets , derivatives pricing and business
knowledge that i had gained over the last few years at enron .
2 . there has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me . i
now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year .
of the current six members , five joined us only this year and most of them
didn ' t have any prior work experience , thus requiring a lot of my time in
recruiting , training and mentoring .
3 . given that i had to visit our bombay office in january , 2000 for a
business trip ( 10 days ) and will need to go there again in january , 2001 , i
could not take leave from my work for the other two units ( ees & epg ) for an
extended period of time .
so , in summary , this year has been a long and challenging one , and as a
result , i could not take vacation for more than a few days . i request you to
grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year .
currently i have 136 hours of vacation available and , of these , i expect to
have 112 hours unused at the end of this year .

new combustion turbine at the florida / georgia border , bidding on a portfolio
of power plants up for sale in nepool , valuing a retail portfolio in
pennsylvania .
2 . model should be estimated on a particular data set . examples : daily nymex
close prices for palo verde , pjm hourly spot prices for 1998 - 1999 .
3 . case study should describe several candidate models , for volatility
and / or market price , that were considered . case study should discuss why
these models were considered . candidate models should be described
mathematically and verbally .
4 . evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
identified , and quantified to the extent possible . examples of evaluation
criteria : residuals that are not autorcorrelated , stationarity , r - squared ,
akaike information criterion .
5 . parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed . the
estimation procedure employed should be briefly described .
6 . some diagnostics of model fit ( vis - a - vis data set ) should be presented .
7 . if possible , predictive power of model should be assessed .
generally , the case study should include all of the items above . the case
study may include other things .

"Subject: re : uk power / gas
vince , just fyi :
oliver ( risk control in london ) was asking if it is appropriate to use a set
of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity .
this "" mapping "" we do quite frequently in our var system when forward prices
for a commodity are not correlated ( because of poor price history ) .
i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we can not trust these
correlations based on illiquid price information .
if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in
the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors - then
we might use more factors then 7 or the matrix itself .

subject : re : uk power / gas
oliver ,
i completely agree with you : validating var inputs like positions , prices and
volatilities which are used by risktrac is the first thing to do .
you also rise a valid question : if the factor loadings for some commodity do
not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity ?
the factor loadings "" do not make sense "" when the correlations across the term
structure are not high . so if we believe that the forward prices for this
commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces
the correlations which we trust , then it would be proper to use this
correlation matrix in var engine , not the factors . using factors is simply
the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without
sacrificing the accuracy .

naveen
regarding the calculation of uk vars in risk trac i agree that we should be
using this calculation engine for all commodity vars . however we should not
focus solely on the uk but ensure that we use risk trac for continental power
and gas , uk power and gas , nordic power .
to use risk trac i think the following need to be resolved first , to
implement it "" right the first time "" , as i think it is incorrect to consider
the risk trac numbers "" as the most accurate "" since it depends on the validity
of these items :
positions ( delta and gamma ) and curve mapping - these need to include all
positions including those outside the main risk systems
positions , curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds ,
apart from continental power , have been uat ' d and we have the spreadsheet
feeds up and running .
price and vol curves - as used by the risk systems
as above
inter commodity correlation - prompt month
correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data
set ( however the incomplete historic data for europe in risk trac , prior to
the formation of the task force , would mean a full data set needs to be
obtained and used ) . term structure of correlation would be good but i
understand this is difficult to use in the calculation .
factor loadings
i think factor loadings should be calculated , on the same data sets used
for inter commodity correlation , for all commodities . if this analysis does
not appear to work i am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets
is adequate . do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating
var for these markets ?
to ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones ,
responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise i fear the
process of moving across to risk trac from the spreadsheet var will
experience some slippage .
i will call today to start the process off .

subject : uk power / gas
oliver ,
i had a couple of issues pertaining to uk power / uk gas . first ,
just a few notes as it pertains to risk trac uk - implementation :
( 1 ) in risktrac , currently all the gas curves are mapped to nbp .
( 2 ) all the power curves are mapped to r 4 ( cinergy ) .
factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves ( for
reasons of liquidity , etc ) . we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the
best curves available at this time .
the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a
2 - 3 - year old set of factors derived from us nat gas , which is clearly not
optimal . hence
( 1 ) we should be using risktrac numbers for var , as it is the "" most
accurate "" , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most
recent updated data . ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks
ago , the uk power number has been consistently 7 - 8 mm above the numbers in
your spreadsheet . this difference is to be ecpected , given the different
inputs .
( 2 ) the consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way ,
however , if you believe that positions are not captured correctly , please let
our it staff know that .
( 3 ) checks which ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in .
however , as you know , there could be disconnects with enpower , etc .
in any event , it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run

daren - - - on the 12 th , there is a sale to aquila on the header system , for
10 , 000 . . . . . . . . i think we were supplying it with aec . for whatever reason , i
had the aec 10 . 0 @ # 11230 into midcon . . . which isnt right because there was no
market for it , and midcon wasnt looking for it , but the aquila deal was at
# 700 on wgr ( aquila ) . so i went ahead and changed the aec ticket to match up
with the aquila deal . let me know if you think it is incorrect .

attn : sir / madan
strictly confidential .
i am pleased to introduce myself to you . my name is mr . manuel oko a native of south africa and a senior employee of mines and natural resources department currently on a trainning course in holland for few months .
i am writing this letter to request your assistance in order to redeem an investment with the south african mining corporation . the said investment , now valued at ( $ 15 . 5 million dollars ) fifteen million , five hundred thousand dollars only was purchased by lucio harper and contracted out to the south african mining corporation in 1977 now recognised as mines and natural resources department . this redeemable investment interest , has now matured since march last year .
since march last year , several attempts have been made to contact lucio harper without success and there is no way to contact any of his close relatives in whose favour the investment cash value can be paid .
since we have access to all lucio harper ' s information , we can claim this money with the help of my partners with the south african mines and natural resources department . all we have to do is to file claim using you as lucio harper ' s relative .
i will like to assure you that there is absolutely nothing to worry about , because it is perfectly safe with no risk involved . please ensure to keep this matter strictly confidential . my partner will file a claim for this money on your behalf from the southafrican mining corporation . when the claim is approved , you as the beneficiary
will be paid ( 25 % ) of the total amouth .
since this money can be paid directly into any bank account of your choice , you have responsibility to ensure that my partner and ireceive ( 70 % ) of the total amouth . while the balance ( 5 % ) will be set aside for any unforseen expenses in the cause of transfering this money .
i will appreciate if you can give your assurance and guarantee that our share will be well secured . please for the sake of confidentiality , reach me on my e - mail address : manuelokol 000 @ netscape . net . please let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you . kindly reach me immediately with any of the stated contact addresses so that better clearifications
relating to the transaction will be explained to you .

sorry i ' m just now getting back to you . here are some answers to your
questions .
waskom is a field in east texas ( harrison county ) where we purchase gas from
pennzenergy at the bryson c . p . and jeter # 2 wells . the gas is termed up to
new
waskom gas gathering ( nwgg ) through june 2001 ( the term of the pennzenergy
purchase ) . we then buy the gas back from nwgg into our tetco east texas pool
. . . also termed up through 6 / 01 .
virginia field used to be associated with ngpl , but several years ago
pennzenergy worked out a processing arrangement with corpus christi gas
gathering , so the gas is now termed up with ccgm through 6 / 01 . . . priced off
of
the houston ship channel .
jennings ranch used to flow into ngpl through a gathering line , but a couple
of
years ago ngpl sold that line to midcon texas , so we now handle it as another
midcon texas property . sometimes we sell it at the meter to midcon texas
( kn ) ,
and sometimes we ship it through midcon to our ngpl south texas pool .
carthage : altra picks up their gas in their cartwheel agreement . the
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement . it is not much
different than a hub agreement , except it allows title tracking . tgt on the
whiteboard refers to texas gas . . . east ohio takes their gas into texas gas on
a couple of different transport contracts .
let me know if you have more questions .

vasant ,
i enjoyed our telephone conversation this morning . from our conversation ,
it sounds like enron is moving out on the cutting edge of risk transfer and
insurance finance . in my mind , there seem to be a myriad number of
interesting opportunities moving forward . as well , i see a number of issues
that would need to be resolved . frankly , i find that quite exciting . i
left academics largely because i wanted to move into a more "" front line ""
career . while i ' ve enjoyed my work here at the naic , it is still not where i
ultimately see myself . i gathered from your comments some concern about my
being too senior in the organization . if i am interpreting you correctly ,
you are concerned about hands on technical work . i enjoy that immensely and
some of the strengths i bring to the table are the ability to think
creatively about solving financial problems and the the ability to make data
tell the underlying story .
i look forward to talking to you next week . i just found out that our
office building will be closed monday , so i will not be in until tuesday

following up on the telephone conversation , please see the attached

pricing was centered on the 42 . 315 k per month volume band so that you can get
a good feel for copier expenditure based on average month volumes . i have
left the spreadsheet "" unprotected "" so that you can play with the volume
figures and see how this changes the price overall + how the "" cost per image ""
is affected by volume changes .

"Subject: california energy crisis
california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron ' s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a "" turnback "" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :
? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .
? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .
? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .
enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .
increasing supply
california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .",0

2 . calculating factors and correlations for uk curves ;
3 . joint estimation of factor loading for selected groups of commodities ;

2 . run var code in stage and validate the results .
it is time to start releasing these 4 versions . projects 3 and 4 require some

revision - according to measurement , there is flow of 7 , 394 in 8 / 98 , however ,
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on hpl in oss . i
checked mips and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate
of 7 , 394 mmbtu .
daren is there a deal in cpr which may not have fed over to oss ? i checked
oss for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in oss . it does
seem strange that this is the only month of flow .

"Subject: investment opportunity .
dear friend ,
you will be surprise to see this message but i got your information
through spartanburg , area chamber of commerce usa .
my name is howard jones , a chief auditor , during my last auditing in
the
in london , uk we realized the sum $ 35 . 5 million owned by one patric zuma
from egypt who died
in a fatal motor accident in nov . 15 , 2004 while he was away on vacation
in egypt .
all efforts , made to reach the relatives of mr . patric zuma for the past
two years , have not yielded any positive result . it was later gathered
that mr . zuma ? s divorced wife died some two years ago in gaza .
in our last board meeting , the directors jointly decided that mr . zuma ? s
money should be included in the annual profit for the year 2005 . since
i was the one who introduced mr . zuma to the bank , i objected to the
decision and demanded that the fund remains floating in the treasury
for another one year to see if we could actually get the relatives of
mr . zuma to claim the money .
i am seeking your partnership to transfer this funds to your account
for your co - operation and assistance i willcompensate you with 25 %
70 % percent for me and 5 % set aside for any saundry expenses .
with your consent , we will put up a claim on your behalf as next of kin
to mr . zuma , iwill send you all the documents to you . once this is
done ,
the claims & verification dept will have the funds processed and wired to
your account , then we can meet to share the money together .
please i want you to keep this information very confidential as the
exposure of this information might even lead to my life imprisonment or
death . if you are not willing to assist me , then i will beg you to
still keep the informations secret .
let me have your telephone number so that i can reach you if you need
me to call you . i look forward to hearing from you soon . i am presently
in london on special duties .

vince ,
i appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the
last . however , my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon
and i wasn ' t sure i would get back to this before leaving tomorrow . the
only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro
plus the addition of "" unused information "" at the end of the document . the
unused stuff is made up of notes i made from hamel , some news stories ,
press releases , and random thoughts . we probably won ' t use any of this
stuff but i wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful .
the challenge we face at this stage ( and where i can most use your help ) is
in documenting enron ' s risk management functions in a meaningful way . this
may be best done through examples or in some other way . i think that our
audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed
examples ( even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don ' t
interrupt the flow of the article . if you ' ll make a pass at what you feel
is appropriate i ' ll gladly polish on the words as i try to learn about what
you are doing myself .

subject : contemporary poetry
guys ,
just thought you might find this interesting . ? i was forwarded this
poem , and told it was written by a high school student in az .
regardless , of who / where ( not the point ) i find it interesting , weirdly
amusing , and frighteningly fairly accurate . - pb
now i sit me down in school
where praying is against the rule
for this great nation under god
finds mention of him very odd .
if scripture now the class recites ,
it violates the bill of rights .
and anytime my head i bow
becomes a federal matter now .
our hair can be purple , orange or green ,
that ' s no offense , it ' s a freedom scene .
the law is specific , the law is precise .
prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice .
for praying in a public hall
might offend someone with no faith at all .
in silence alone we must meditate ,
god ' s name is prohibited by the state .
we ' re allowed to cuss and dress like freaks ,
and pierce our noses , tongues and cheeks .
they ' ve outlawed guns , but first the bible .
to quote the good book makes me liable .
we can elect a pregnant senior queen ,
and the ' unwed daddy , ' our senior king .
it ' s "" inappropriate "" to teach right from wrong ,
we ' re taught that such "" judgments "" do not belong .
we can get our condoms and birth controls ,
study witchcraft , vampires and totem poles .
but the ten commandments are not allowed ,
no word of god must reach this crowd .
it ' s scary here i must confess ,
when chaos reigns the school ' s a mess .
so , lord , this silent plea i make ,
should i be shot ; my soul please take !

"Subject: vega v @ r , credit reserve model update
attached is a draft of the vega var implement documentation . we will discuss
this issue tomorrow .
index var and the vega var status :
because any modification of the var model has to be coded into the new
version by it , the index var model and the vega var model are on the waiting
list to get into it group ' s door . currently , they are struggling with the
credit model . accord to jonathan le , they will implement the "" prudency ""
model after the "" credit "" and before anything else . so , it ' s uncertain when
they can begin these two projects .
credit reserve model status :
new version developed by it is still in the debugging stage . two major
difference exist between the new and old versions :
1 ) old version uses delta - gammar methodology , new version uses full
evaluation . it group is not comfortable with their implementation of the
"" spread option "" and "" swaption "" evaluation . i am working with them on it .
2 ) insurance projects are new to the new version . it also wants our help too .
only after the it finishes the debugging process , could we start testing the
new version with the current one .
thanks .
