ham," capital book  to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .  the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .  the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .  capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .  on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .  by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .  questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :  joe deffner 853 - 7117  alan quaintance 345 - 7731"

ham," re :  dear navroz  thanks for getting back to me . the reason there has been a dialogue ( not , i  should point out , with nick , but with shan millie ) , is that my work is of  quite a large size , and needs to find an appropriate home . the question is  should it go into a compilation book , or somehow be published in the  magazine ? i was awaiting some feedback from risk on the best course of  action .  we were hoping to publish a cut down version in the magazine , and a full  version in risk ' s upcoming "" game choices "" book , but i ' ve heard nothing from  your organisation until now ( and i fear we ' ve now missed the boat on the game  choices book deadline ) . i ' m attaching the full internal enron document for  your reference , and i ' d appreciate your thoughts on how best to put the  article in your journal . since the subject is highly diagrammatic , i ' m  concerned that 4000 words may be too many when coupled with diagrams ! ( it is  currently only 6000 words , but is around 25 a 4 pages long . ) if you can give  me some guidance on the issue of publishing extensive diagrams as part of the  text , i ' ll get to work chopping my work around until it suits your preferred  format .  shan millie gave me some good feedback on general points of style and clarity  in my writing , but incorporating these would actually make the article longer  rather than shorter . i think you ' d better look the document over before i do  further work on it .  i look forward to your response .  many thanks ,  steve leppard  enron capital & trade resources corp .  from : "" navroz patel ""  04 / 28 / 2000 03 : 25 pm  please respond to "" navroz patel ""  to :  cc :  subject :  dear steven ,  my name is navroz patel and i am the technical assistant at risk magazine . i  am contacting you with regards to your initial dialogue with nick dunbar .  we would be grateful if you could email to both of the addresses below a  copy of your ' real options ' article for our consideration .  please note that articles must have full references , be approximately 4000  words in length , and the attachment should be in ms word or pdf format .  npatel @ risk . co . uk  ndunbar @ risk . co . uk  ?  thank you for your interest .  yours sincerely ,  navroz patel .  technical assistant , risk magazine ."

ham," summer intern : paulo oliveira  vince : here is the information that i have on paulo . he would be slated  to work for the summer with april hodgeson and matt harris on how streaming  media products may add value to advertising or some related area .  actually , he would also be a good fit for helping to think ways to analyze  our enron on - line data . i have asked if he can send a resume . in the  mean time , most of his relevant information is attached below .  - - stinson  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by stinson gibner / hou / ect on 02 / 17 / 2000  11 : 14 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  paulo rocha e oliveira on 02 / 10 / 2000 12 : 04 : 56 pm  to : "" stinson gibner ""  cc :  subject : re : trip to houston  stinson ,  thank you for your e - mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) ."

ham," re : insead high - tech acquisitions workshop  ben  thanks for attending . i was on "" vacation "" last week ( driving from ca to  houston )  and could not answer your first message regardoing insead conference in time .  the objective was to find out more about the he workshop on high - tech  acquisitions  and evaluate the usefulness of the program for enron . i shall be making a  recommendation  to jeff skilling that we should work with wharton as a partner in a number of  different research projects .  i shall try to catch you next week to find out what was said about valuation  of small high - tech firms .  vince  benjamin parsons  06 / 12 / 2000 05 : 50 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : bryan seyfried / lon / ect @ ect  subject : insead high - tech acquisitions workshop  vince  i attended the workshop on high - tech acquisitions at insead on saturday  alongside participants from cisco , eads , razorfish and cable + wireless , and  academics from insead and wharton . the basic premise was to discuss and get  feedback from practitioners about the research project , and a phd study which  is currently underway at wharton . the discussions were very interesting -  especially as this was my first exposure to this area .  examples of the discussions raised include  why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in - house  what degree of post - acquisition integration was optimal  difficulties of us firms acquiring euro / asian high - tech companies  how to value small high - tech firms  how to quantify the success / failure of an acquisition  my feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to  enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give  us first - hand access to the results . plus it would enable us to learn from  the mistakes of others , through meeting practitioners at such workshops and  having greater access to the case studies . i guess it could also aid our  realignment within the high - tech / communication industry to be seen in such  studies .  regards  ben"

ham," option pricing discrepancy for j . c . penny transaction  amitava and seksan have identified the source of the discrepancy between the  option prices calculated by the credit - reserve model and the stand - alone  spreadsheet model used in deal pricing . the discrepancy can be traced to  differences in input variables of the two models and not to any algorithmic  differences .  the options being priced are a strip of options on monthly instruments . the  credit reserve simulation program calculates the time to expiration by  assuming that the option expires on first day of the contract month of the  underlying contract , which is a very reasonable assumption .  the stand - alone option pricing spreadsheet allows specification of the option  expiration date independent of the contract month of the underlying . in the  jc penney transaction , the monthly options were assumed to expire in the  middle of the contract month , when in reality the underlying monthly  contracts expire before the start of their respective contract months . the  stand - alone spreadsheet model allows such specifications and it is up to the  user to ascertain that the expiration dates entered are legal . at present ,  seksan is ascertaining that the option contracts involved are in deed monthly  options and not a strip of daily options , in which case we would require  estimates of intramonth volatilities for both the spreadsheet model and the  credit reserve model .  regards ,  rabi de"

( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of  our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the  same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest  you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting  that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  ( see attached file : license . doc )"

"" the 326 companies  we surveyed are planning on an 18 . 2 percent increase , versus a 10 . 2 percent  rise budgeted in december , "" said james d .  crandell , who follows oil services and drilling for the new york investment  banker .  he emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in lehman ' s survey reflects  increases in budgets for 2000 and not  underspending of budgets during 1999 . "" among the companies that were  included in our december 1999 and may 2000  surveys , global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated  to have been spent during 1999 in december . it  also indicates that nearly $ 6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide  exploration budgets since december , "" crandell said .  the survey ' s respondents said that they planned to increase u . s . e & p  expenditures by 17 . 6 percent , up from 15 . 9 percent  earlier in the year . crandell said that the greater increase was driven  almost entirely by independent producers . "" in our survey ,  227 independents indicated e & p spending growth in 2000 of 26 . 1 percent  versus a 22 . 9 percent increase budgeted for the  year in december , "" he indicated . "" some 40 percent of the independents we  surveyed have increased their u . s . e & p budgets ,  while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last  december . higher natural gas prices and increased  cash flow are the main drivers behind this . ""  crandell said that anadarko petroleum corp . ( nyse : apc ) , apache corp . ( nyse :  apa ) , bhp petroleum , h . s . resources inc .  ( nyse : hse ) , mcmoran exploration co . ( nyse : ran ) , mdu resources group inc .  ( nyse : mdu ) , mitchell energy and  development corp . ( nyse : mnd . a and mnd . b ) , santa fe snyder corp . ( nyse :  sfs ) , stone energy corp . ( nyse : sgy ) and  titan exploration inc . - now pure resources inc . ( nyse : prs ) - were among  the larger independents to make the most  significant upward revisions . the ones that significantly reduced planned  u . s . e & p outlays for the year included barrett  resources corp . ( nyse : brr ) , belco oil and gas corp . ( nyse : bog ) , burlington  resources inc . ( nyse : br ) , coastal corp .  ( nyse : cgp ) , forcenergy inc . ( nyse : fen ) , houston exploration co . ( nyse :  hex ) , kerr - mcgee corp . ( nyse : kmg ) , mariner  energy corp . and williams production co .  the survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage  gain in their 2000 u . s . e & p expenditures ( 8 . 8  percent ) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year ( 8 . 4 percent ) .  among the 14 companies in this category , 31  percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 e & p spending estimates  during the first six months , including amerada hess  corp . ( nyse : ahc ) , conoco inc . ( nyse : coc . a and coc . b ) , occidental petroleum  corp . ( nyse : oxy ) and total fina elf s . a .  ( nyse : tot ) . another 19 percent - including eni spa ( nyse : e ) , royal  dutch / shell ( nyse : rdp and stt ) and texaco inc .

"" compared with  december , 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000  by more than 10 percent , while 20 percent  have reduced it by more than 10 percent . the remaining 39 percent have kept  it within 10 percent of what was originally  estimated , "" crandell said . talisman energy inc .

( nyse : mur ) , pan canadian  petroleum ltd . ( tse : pcp ) and shell canada ltd . ( tse : shc ) . like their u . s .  counterparts , producers above the border raised  their 2000 e & p budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash  flow , according to the lehman analyst .  he said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise : "" the 14 . 9  percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas  companies that have operations outside the united states and canada was well  above the 5 . 7 percent increase for 2000  estimated last december . as in other geographies , there were more companies  that increased budgets than decreased them . ""  overall , crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised  their 2000 e & p budgets by more than 10 percent , 43  estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated  that they would spend less than originally planned .  he said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which  materially increased their budgets , including  texaco , petroleos brasileiros s . a . , petroleos mexicanos s . a . and repsol ypf  s . a . ( nyse : rep ) among the multinationals and  amerada hess , apache , premier oil plc . and woodside energy among mid - sized  companies .  crandell noted that while respondents ' average price assumptions rose during  2000 ' s first six months ( to $ 22 . 04 from $ 19 . 25  per barrel of crude oil and to $ 2 . 58 from $ 2 . 38 per thousand cubic feet of  natural gas ) , they still trail current prices and what  lehman brothers estimates for the year ( $ 28 per barrel of crude and $ 3 . 30  per mcf of gas ) .

ham," alliance info alert : richardson and ferc orders  dear generation / power marketing executive :  the following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred  friday , december 15  1 . energy secretary richardson issuance of an emergency order .  ( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s  web site at :  http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html )  2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets  ( ferc ' s order can be viewed at  california supplies ordered by richardson  o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso  o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 ,  unless extended  o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later  o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977  as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill  richardson found "" an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage  of electric energy "" and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of  the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to  provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the  california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the  reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in  the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts .  the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it  has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing  requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to  the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm ,  eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order  directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among  subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power .  the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern  time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies  under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe  headquarters every 24 hours .  the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers  to the iso "" are to be agreed to by the parties . "" if no agreement is reached ,  then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson "" will  immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to  the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date  by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will  prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and  reasonable . "" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe  organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from ferc to doe .  the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities  are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and  transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by  the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . ""  [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;  electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]  ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural  reforms  a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion  at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major  outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the  responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at  the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .  ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,  california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman  hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .  hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission  had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on  november 1 , as discussed below .  highlights of key actions :  ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,  the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules  effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed  opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly  "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california ."

ham," steve leppard  hi vince ,  hr is working on a mid - year salary review for london people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement . they highlighted steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what we ' re seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research .  i ' d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and  keep him at enron . there are several things i see we can do :  1 ) give him a mid - year pay increase to move him closer to market . i ' m not  sure this is the best way to go , especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase .  2 ) offer him more responsibility : what are your thoughts on timing for  making steve the official head of the london research team ? with my move to  ebs , should we accelerate this ? i think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated , and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year - end ( as part of the regular process ) that takes into account his greater  responsibility .  3 ) we have some people that we ' re trying to get under long - term ( 3 - yr )  contract with a 12 - month notice clause . obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up - front compensation for being handcuffed .  we ' ve not had a lot of success with these here in london , and i would prefer  to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job .  i ' d value your thoughts on this .  thanks ,  dale"

ham," eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading  strategy  please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some  typos .  greg and john ,  i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially  because in a trending market  we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose  market move from  $ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread  is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5  trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is  ( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading  volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one  trade , the total mtm is  - 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that  particular day .  therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades , we can be more  profitable as a market maker .  i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl .  i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3 . almost in all  cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked "" change "" for  dollar amount change in millions .  please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this .  regards ,  zimin lu  x 36388  as compared to"

( in high speed communication bandwidth scenarios , for example ,  the dimensions could be price , bandwidth size , time for which bandwidth  available , continguity of the allocation , and such . )  2 ) it involves dynamic matching as opposed to "" static "" matching .  3 ) it is multi - lateral .  4 ) it adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions .  5 ) it allows traders to make important trade - offs , as they do in  traditional markets .  currently , skg is involved in discussions with the heads of trading at  fidelity , putnam investments , lehman bros . , kpmg , meridien research ,  salomon smith barney , jp morgan , state street , banc of america , mckinsey ,  citizens power , and a host of other folks .  we think we have a value - adding service to provide to enron online or any  other enron subsidiary that the skg offering matches and that you deem fit .  skg ' s founders and i will be very happy to provide you or your  representative ( s ) with more details , including a demo of the prototype , in  a meeting . we are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange  something appropriate .  thanks very much , jeff ! we look forward to hearing from you .  with warm regards ,  joseph cherian and robert jarrow  cc : professor robert c . merton  joseph a . cherian  associate professor of finance  boston university school of management  595 commonwealth avenue , room 522 h  boston , ma 02215  tel : 617 - 353 - 2679 ( o )  617 - 353 - 6667 ( fax )"

 i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed  slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corporation , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity  markets . this chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail  the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process  assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . examples  from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the  technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables ."

ham," p + option valuation model  mark ,  after recently reviewing the booking of the p + options , it is my  understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread  option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are  assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes ( i . e . the price  process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions  extended to two commodities ) .  the payoff for a call option is :  payoff = max ( 0 , a  ) b  ) k ) .  where :  a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex )  b = posting price = ( wti swap )  ) ( posting basis )  k = posting bonus ( fixed ) .  the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options  is that leg "" b "" of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two  futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the  average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these  prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg "" b "" and  the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of  prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this  approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use  a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and  correlation matrices .  in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of  these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly .  regards ,  stinson gibner  v . p . research"

ham," re : mg metals : summary of var methodology and current status  dear all ,  anjam and myself had a highly productive and informative set of meetings  with andreas barkchis of mg metals ny on thursday 20 th july in the ny  office . firstly we should say "" thanks "" to andreas for being so helpful in  addressing out numerous requests for information - we look forward to  establishing a solid working relationship with him going forward .  find below a summary of version _ 1 a for initial rough calculation of mg  metal ' s var .  also anjam , kirstee ( from london side ) and cantekin , grant , vince and myself  ( houston side ) have been working for last 2 days on the spreadsheet var  model .  the current status of this effort and a plan for future progress is  summarized in the enclosed document :  v @ r methodology for mg metals positions  version _ 1 a  introduction  this document describes the initial rough model for calculations  value - at - risk for mg metals . this model will be implemented in a spreadsheet ,  which will serve as a prototype for the risktrac implementation .  risk factors  the following positions represent most of mg metal  , s risk and will be covered  by version _ 1 a :  - base metals  , positions including :  - aluminium ;  - copper ;  - gold ;  - lead ;  - nickel ;  - silver ;  - tin ;  - zinc ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward  prices for each metal .  - copper concentrate ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating tc charges .  - cocoa beans ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward  prices for cocoa beans .  therefore these 10 curves will drive the risk : price curves for aluminium ,  copper , gold , lead , nickel , silver , tin , zinc and cocoa beans plus tc curve  for copper concentrate .  assumptions and simplifications :  - for each metal we are going to use a single price curve or all types of  products ( physical , financial , lme traded , comex traded , scrap , alloy , stock ,  etc . ) ;  - delta , gamma approach for risk on options  , positions ;  components required to implement v @ r model :  - current forward prices available from mercur ;  - current implied volatilities available through reuters ;  - current positions from mercur ;  - history of prices required to calculate factor loadings and correlations  across commodities ;  methodology  version _ 1 a will be based on risk matrix approach . we will calculate principal  components for each metal and cocoa beans to take in account the correlations  along the term structure . we will also calculate the correlations across  commodities based on prompt month prices history for last 3 months .  portfolio hierarchy  each position will be assigned to one of the following portfolios under the  whole portfolio agg - metals :  - mg metal  - mg metal  - mg metall recycling gmbh , ffm ;  under each of these sub - portfolio there will be the following sub - portfolios :  - comex ;  - frame contract ;  - lme ;  - lme alloy ;  - lme metal index ;  - option call ;  - option put ;  - physical ;  - physical alloy ;  - physical real ;  - physical scrap ;  - price part . ;  - prov . billing ;  - stock ;  - stock alloy ;  - stock comex ;  - stock physical ;  - stock scrap ;"

spam," urgent contact  from the desk of : dr tom eke .  e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com  lagos - nigeria .  attn :  request for urgent business relationship .  it is with my profound dignity that i write you this  very important  and highly confidential letter . first , i must  solicit your strictest  confidentiality in this transaction . this is by  virtue of its nature  as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" .  though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried , considering the fact that we have not met  each other before ,  but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day . we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction , as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you ,  so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year  2000 .  however , let me start by introducing myself properly  to you . i  am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel . our duties  include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds . the source of this funds is as  follows : in the second  quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt . during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over - inflate the  total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431  million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves .  the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us  as the contract sum ,  and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done , but  since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million  dollars only , we are  now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel , we cannot do  this by ourselves ,  as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau  ( civil service  laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service , making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now . i have  therefore , been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are  writing you this  letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf , you or your  company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31  million ) , while  70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 %  will be used in  offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to  say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust .  you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below ;  a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody , or any form of blackmail .  d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from  the total amount .  please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .  we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us .  transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives . here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day , thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future , so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty . i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you .  please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e - mail address .  i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction . i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .  yours faithfully ,  dr . tom eke .  n . b . please be informed that this business  transaction is 100 % legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering . this is a  complete legitimate business transaction .  - -"
ham," your encouragement would be appreciated  the gas and power trading organizations have had a tremendous year .  sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization  that significantly contributed to that success . i believe the weather group  comprised of mike robert ' s , jose marquez , stephen bennett and dave ryan from  power are one of those groups . these individuals have done a tremendous job  of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take . the  greatest achievement has been the november and december winter forecast .  they held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were  moderating . on a score card with all other services they definitely deserve  an "" a + "" . when you are down on the 32 nd floor it would be nice if you would  stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our  success .  thanks , jim schwieger"

spam," info you requested kcc  thank you for your interest !  judgment coursesoffers an extensive training  course in "" how to collect moneyjudgments ""  if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a  money judgment is and why processing money judgments  can earn you very substantial income .  if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you  will have a money judgment against them .  you are happy you won but you will soon find out the  shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the  judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you .  the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser  down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts ,  real estate , stocks and bonds , etc .  very few people know how to find these assets or what to do  when they are found . the result is that millions of  judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten .  in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a  dime .  the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic  proportions . right now in the united states there is  between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney  judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more  judgments take its place .  we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have  actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this  business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid  profession in which only a select few will be trained in the  techniques necessary to succeed .  with our first hand experience we have built a course which  teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown  and exciting field of processing money judgments .  by following the steps laid out in our course and with  reasonable effort you can become very successful in the  processing of money judgments .  the income potential is substantial in this profession . we  have associates who have taken our course and are now  working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per  year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00  and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of  their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable  organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business  offices .  today our company and our associates have over 126  million dollars in money judgments that we are currently  processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form  of joint ventures between our firm and our associates .  joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break  even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on  the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting  capability is so extensive that government agencies , police  officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us  for reports .  many of our associates already have real estate liens in  force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars .  legally this means that when the properties are sold or  refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 %  interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments .  annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to  $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the  payment of the principal .  our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per  year . this is just for interest , not counting principle  and not counting the compounding of the interest which can  add substantial additional income . typically companies are  sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest  an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell  their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars .  92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 %  are women and 36 % are part time .  one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are  not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off  for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are  working on will be there when you return . the judgments  are still in force , they do not disappear .  the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your  computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you  never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you  are . you are not a collection agency .  simply stated the steps to successful money processing  are as follows :  mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals  with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who  to write to )  8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you  and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them  unless you want to .  you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to  sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and  50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for  $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 .  you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor  and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to  assist you . they range from credit reports from all three  credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment  locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc .  the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to  1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge  $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other  companies charge $ 25 . 00 .  once you find the debtor and their assets you file  garnishments and liens on the assets you have located .  ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the  course )  when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to  the original judgment holder .  once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of  judgment to the court . ( included in the course )  quote ' s from several of our students :  thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop  you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my  first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your  professionalism in both the manual and your support .  you have the video opened doors for me in the future .  there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states  he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on ""  after only having this course for four months , larry s . in  area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per  week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the  next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in  judgments i am collecting on now ""  after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated  "" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately  $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i  will have to hire someone to help out ""  marshal in area code 407 states to us "" i feel bad , you only  charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i  have added 3 full time people to help me after only having  your course for 5 months ""  > from the above information and actual results you can see  why we can state the following :  with our course you can own your own successful business .  a business which earns you substantial income now and one  which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to  retire on and travel the world . a business which is  extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every  day is new and exciting .  none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is  challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate  downsizing . a business which you can start part time from  your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full  time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from  others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you  control your own destiny . our training has made this happen  for many others already . make it happen for you !  if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you  to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation  on your part .  please call us at 1 - 281 - 500 - 4018 .  we have service support staff available to you from 8 : 00 am to  10 : 00 pm ( central time ) 7 days a week . if you callthis number  you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel .  they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation .  sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations  of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let  you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you  read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person  can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we  merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to  work with us or not .  thank you for your time and interest .  + + + + +  this ad is produced and sent out by :  uas  to be excluded from our mailing list please email us at eds @ saiyan . com with "" exclude "" in the sub - line .  or write us at : adminscript - update , p o b 1 2 0 0 , o r a n g e s t a d , a r u b a  + + + + + +  5 ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' to 48 5 - 28 c 30 p  - sspltm - 30 "

"" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion ."

"" he noted that the only reason they haven ' t yet is that "" they were too stupid to ring - fence the parent "" and that "" their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it . ""  he added that the davis / socal mou is dead and that all the "" plan b ' s "" are "" speculative "" at best . he also thought that socal was being "" naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court . ""  2 . bond issuance - $ 12 b not enough  angelides conceded that a $ 12 b bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 - 24 b . the only reason they didn ' t issue more is that angelides felt that "" $ 12 b was all the market could handle . "" the current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400 / mwh , which angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from state comptroller ' s kathleen connell ' s office .  3 . new generator construction  anglelides was explicit that the california public power authority ( authorized by the legislature last week ) will "" build plants and not stop until we [ california ] has a 10 - 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand . angelides expects the state to be "" 5 - 10 % short on power all summer .

ham," energy leader consulting generation evaluator ( ege )  shirley :  as requested , herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski .  the presentation on the ege tool ' s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour . if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday , may 29 , might i request it be set for late afternoon ( as my other appointments are the next day ) .  and , as vince will recall , i was co - leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly , and developer of the ramp up , real time , 75 check and electric strategy tools . presently , i am ceo of energy leader consulting ( elc ) .  background  the u . s . power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years . rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively . utilities , who still control most power plants , endeavor to adopt the entrants ' methods . yet , inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread .  utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades - old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling . many utilities , notwithstanding the industry - wide trend towards profit maximization , cling to ingrained routines .  inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale . a utility may operate a relatively small system ( fewer than a dozen plants ) . a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers , playing the wholesale market at the margin .  for a variety of reasons , utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units , let alone shut down any ( even temporarily or seasonally ) . economically inefficient units continue to be committed , week after week , and run in the half - load range .  ege objectives  ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines . taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant .  i . an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long - term wholesale power transaction with a utility ; or to price wholesale power more aggressively , to take market share from the utility ( i . e . , compel changes in unit commitment habits ) .  ii . an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition .  iii . a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility ' s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized .  specific ege concepts  ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities .  it produces indicative statistics such as :  a . the frequency distribution of starts per week ;  b . the frequency distribution of starts by day / 15 - minute segment during the week ;  c . the frequency distribution of load level ;  d . the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start ;  e . average heat rate and approximate fully - allocated cost in the half - load range ;  f . average ramp rate from the half - load range ;  g . the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours ; and  h . forced - off maintenance outage rate ( where indicated ) .  indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month / year ; in some cases , by temperature range . ( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .  ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .  other ege supporting data :  i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;  j . actual maximum generating capacity ;  k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;  l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and  m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .  with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .  the real - world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .  another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .  offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )  ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .  elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :  1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .  2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .  3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .  4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .  steven a . mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street , nw  washington , dc 20016  ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice  ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax  smitnick @ energyleader . com"

ham," preface for book  vince ,  ?  hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !"
ham," market maker simulation v . 2  stinson and vince ,  i finished the second version of the model which deals with open to close  trading .  the major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at open  price which  will affect the p / l .  i also added the output features that john wants to see .  the cumulative p / l is path dependent , the net open allowed seemingly has  a strong influence on the cumulative p / l trajectory . ( the anomaly i  discussed  with vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further  examination ) .  could you review what i have done before we talk to john again ?  zimin"

( this is why  increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for  the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each  plant ' s aggregate values are reported .  i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a  homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql  query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making  appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood  documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i  can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine  at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation ,  so it may be available now .  let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out ,  michael  > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 08 / 24 / 00 07 : 08 am > > >  michael ,  i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i  am currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and  experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard  from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and  consequently the person to contact in case of problems .  i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide  the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the  numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack  and system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each  station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,  marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea  marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations  according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station  detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :  for each hour , for each generating station :  "" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -  vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]  this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a  marginal station which i get on the stack as a result of the above  calculation is not a station given in marginal station field in transarea  marginal units query . i have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and  transarea _ data table but non of the costs there match my results .  do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which  outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?  it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case  could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling  understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .  regards  karolina  - text . htm  - stack generator sql . txt"

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the  ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good  article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )  - chonawee  short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in  fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never  reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise .  however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of  exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that  amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,  you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on  the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime .  let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,  and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as  follow  if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,  you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no  matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of  short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can  cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position ."

ham," re : preface for book  julie ,  the introduction looks fine . i have made some cosmetic changes  ( typos and split infinitives that slipped by ) . you can safely ignore most of  them .  english is not even my second language .  the corrections are in pink .  vince  "" julie "" on 08 / 01 / 2000 07 : 43 : 10 am  to : "" vincejkaminski ""  cc :  subject : preface for book  vince ,  ?  hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !"

ham," re : working gas price model  vince -  i have a simplified version of brad ' s model in mind .  the "" no arbitrage "" condition equates trading margins across the country .  costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network . wellhead supply is  almost completely price - elastic , while burner - tip demand is almost  completely price inelastic . storage is rationalized as a perpetual call  option .  the least time - variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing  gas from storage to the pipeline , followed by the costs of delivering gas  from the wellhead to the pipeline . the intermediate - variant parameters are  the capacity - dependent costs paid to the pipeline ( above shrinkage ) for  transmission . the most time - variant parameters are the trading margins and  the valuations of the storage option .  there are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork .  they are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways : using a short  time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability  mentioned above , or point - estimates ( "" calibrations "" ) using only today ' s data  based on a node - based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with  the same region of origination , albeit markedly different terminus , price  versus capacity similarly , "" competing "" for outflows .  i will write this up for you in scientific word and present it to you at your  earliest convenience .  clayton"

analysis of teleconnections and their expected impact ; 1 to 5 and 6  to 10 day forecasts compared to earthsat ; a 10 day city forecast table for  european cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally  a "" port status report "" describing weather and port conditions in 11 worldwide  ports . update traders ( uk and wx deriv ) on changes or new trends in the oz  models . provide a quality assessment of the uk met 6 to 10 and 1 to 5 day  forecast for uk trading .  1330 ( mon - wed ) : brief the crude and products groups in london and houston .  1600 : review 12 z avn for any major forecast changes and communicate changes  to traders .  weekly : produce a weather article for "" critical mass "" - internal trading  newsletter .  of course between 1000 and 1330 we are looking closely at the us weather for  support to you guys in houston . i ' m still writing the daily us executive  summary as well as producing a 6 to 10 day us forecast .  2 ) requested projects :  * gas fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their  morning report and website . they would like to be able to gather objective  output from as many forecast models as we can get .  * weather derivatives has asked for week ahead , month ahead , and seasonal  outlooks for temperature and precipitation . they have also asked about  creating a tradeable "" nao index "" and developing an in - house model for  forecasting nao .  * continental power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for  power generation and hydro .  * gas fundamentals , uk trading , continental power , weather derivatives and  crude and products have all asked for a european summer outlook for  temperature and precipitation . we expect to have this completed tomorrow .  * the research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data  across spain for temperature and precipitation .  3 ) leads to follow up on :  * elsa in houston asked us to contact some of the softs traders here and let  them know once we were up and running .  * contact chris mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support  for crude and products .  * follow up on a potential morning breifing for continental power  4 ) challenges :  * we ' ve been told that we will be moving locations next week - which might  entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that  have taken almost a week to get fully established . it seems that this office  functions on a "" hot desk "" system where people are constantly moving around .  this will make it very difficult to stay connected - as well as very  difficult for our customers to identify us .  * administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time . assembling  reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually  preparing the reports !  - - -  mike ,  ok - i think that brings you up to speed . i ' ve been amazed at the amount of  feedback we ' ve already gotten and we ' ve only been here 3 days ! on that note  i wanted to let you know that i am fully committed to this project . it seems  that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist tony by my planned  departure date on the 20 th . as such - i can continue in my current role  through my planned vacation - keeping me in london until the 27 th - which is  my current reservation back to houston . i am also open to remaining in  london beyond the 27 th to ensure the success of this project .  hopefully this gives you a good idea as to what ' s gone on in the first few  days here . we look forward to talking to you later today and with you and  vince tomorrow ."

 steve :  i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think  it ' ll work .  just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be  interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying  behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) ,  along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer  response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need  to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe  that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct  marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to  whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other  promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )  because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on  actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than  demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new  entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have  some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many  players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet  utility needs .  i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but  i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to  arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron  might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly )  listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .  thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and  hearing how things are going for you .  regards ,  brad davids  303 - 410 - 5531  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com [ mailto : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com ]  sent : monday , april 10 , 2000 12 : 13 pm  to : brad . davids @ abacus - direct . com  subject : re : possible meeting ?

ham," re : energy derivatives  hi vince ,  hope all is well with you . i ' m looking forward to seeing you again next  week and meeting with grant . can you guys do me favour ? i ' m sending out  some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! )  to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of  the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please  write a sentence or two for your chapter ?  i ' m including what i have already written so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and  trade .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .  finally , we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11 ."

"" so many times that  sensible people have learned to discount such claims .  but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is  doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will  believe it .  true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages  even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable  competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that  market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring  billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the  generators .  but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable  competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of  generators "" gaming the system "" have greatly magnified the crisis .  the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of  more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale  prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has  kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  *  short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought  to be lots of excess capacity .  as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the  state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is  a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly  whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for  other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and  such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that "" generators use forced  outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market ""  * a  view shared by a growing number of other researchers .  which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy  regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently  decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in  place on the california electricity market . i say "" apparently ""  because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to  be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1  vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been  sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the  grounds that it would be ineffectual .  what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in  emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices  have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no  emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity  market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that  it is not .  second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes ,  offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls "" megawatt  laundering ""  * selling power to affiliated companies that for one  reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for  example , the controls do not apply to "" imports "" from neighboring  states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin  borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds  that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at  the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive  to produce inefficiently : "" i predict we will find some plants we  never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they  will be pretty inefficient . ""  the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan .  there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  *  indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well  received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them .  the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it ,  that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf  is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action  was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls  the ferc plan "" a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .  . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to  deflect any political fallout "" from the looming disaster .  whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the  administration have yet to offer california any significant  relief .  00 fo 04 b 3 blabf  visit nytimes . com for complete access to the  most authoritative news coverage on the web ,  updated throughout the day .  become a member today ! it ' s free !  http : / / www . nytimes . com ? eta  how to advertise  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web , please contact alyson  racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media  kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo  for general information about nytimes . com , write to  help @ nytimes . com .  copyright 2001 the new york times company"

standard . com / today / state 2 . asp ? menu = 32  mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march , renni abraham  the financial express , april 23 , 2001  godbole ' s report unearths absurd calculations , maharashtra could use this to wriggle out of the dabhol project , sucheta dalal  it is finally quit india time for enron . though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in dabhol power company ( dpc ) , informed sources say that it has sent feelers to china light it deliberately uses expensive raw material ( ignoring world bank warnings ) , has worked on fanciful demand - supply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions .  in fact , the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs 930 crore more than it should every year . this comprises overcharging of rs 253 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent of the capacity is used for dpc . there ' s also a rs 100 crore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge . by charging more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india , enron collects approximately rs 246 crore extra every year . it has also been collecting rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims . enron has been charging at 1878 kcal / kwh under the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate . this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra .  the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation : a rate of rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans , rs 34 . 5 per dollar as reference rate for phase - i , rs 39 . 35 per dollar as reference rate for phase - ii and a curious rs 42 per dollar for calculating government of india tariff . forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation . all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment .  the godbole committee has established that dpc ' s tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments , the take - or - pay clause and escrow facility ( which is in fact hampering mseb ' s reform particularly in power distribution ) are scrapped . the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system . the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route . it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous , it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra . the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government : "" the public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf "" and has recommended that all documents , including contracts related to all independent power projects ( ipps ) , particularly dpc , should be published by the maharashtra government within two months .  also , having established that demand - supply estimates by the state government were fanciful , the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps . it recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the least - cost plan spelt out by the report . this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance ( patalganga ) , mittals ( bhadravati ) , the bses ( saphale ) and others to set up ipps in maharashtra .  - - -

in - fact "" and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications . top sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and / or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa .  "" in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations under the ppa , the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee , the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings , "" the company resolution said . "" consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies , the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company , "" the resolution added .  according to the resolution , the directors , the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually , are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution , in the name and for and on behalf of the company . against this backdrop , the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa . the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate ( penalty ) of rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january 28 and february 13 .  the state government and mseb , which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh , are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the dpc . the dpc ' s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its "" true and lawful attorney - in - fact "" deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states .  mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year . furthermore , mr cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the day - to - day operation of the company ' s business or exercise its rights and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , monday , april 23 , 2001  dpc seeks ok to exit power project , tamal bandyopadhyay otherwise it cannot be a complete exercise , "" he added .  deshmukh and the mseb team are scheduled to meet union finance minister yashwant sinha and power minister suresh prabhu on monday in new delhi to discuss the stalemate and find a acceptable solution for the same . "" i am meeting sinha and prabhu to request them to take an initiative and send representatives for the negotiations committee , "" he said . deshmukh ' s meeting with the centre comes at a crucial stage as dpc ' s lenders would be meeting in london , on the same day , to decide upon the future finances of the controversy marred 2 , 184 - mw project in dabhol .  moreover , the dpc board is also scheduled to meet on april 25 in london to decide the fate of its $ 900 million project in dabhol , including winding up of its operations . the meeting would discuss the topmost item on the agenda , which was to empower dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up operations in the country . dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore plus interest towards the bills due for the months of december 2000 and january 2001 .  asked whether the centre had send any feel over a possible clubbing together of the arbitration and conciliation processes , deshmukh replied in the negative . deshmukh said mseb chairman vinay bansal along with two senior officials would attend dpc ' s board meeting in london . bansal had said on sunday that mseb would present its case concerning the rs 401 - crore penalty that the loss - making board slapped on dpc on february 28 , for not generating required power within the stipulated time as per the ppa . currently , enron india holds 65 per cent in the $ 900 - million dpc project , which includes mseb ' s 15 per cent , while general electric and bechtel hold 10 per cent each .

""  - - energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole  this could well be the real enron story  a five - member high - powered committee headed by madhav godbole - and including former union economic affairs secretary e . a . s . sarma , hdfc chairman deepak parekh , teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lal - has recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified "" the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision - making process relating to the dabhol project "" . the report , which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook , is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar ( with the congress then ) , the 13 - day bjp - led union government which reworked the deal in 1996 , shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi  "" the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision - making relating to the dabhol project . "" madhav godbole committee report  an investigation , if ordered , could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal . according to the committee , the deal reveals failure of governance , both at the centre and state , and across different agencies . "" it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental , "" the report said , proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved . godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry . this was finally adopted by it . says a congress leader : "" enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation , particularly in the power sector . ""  the proposal has already struck panic . says ncp ' s praful patel : "" if the enron decision has at all been detrimental , it is because of the haste with which phase 2 was cleared by the shiv sena - bjp government . now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron , the important thing is to resolve it amicably . a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it ' s not an issue of corruption but that of perception . ""  pro - market congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron , even though the second phase was cleared by the bjp - shiv sena combine . says congress spokesperson jaipal reddy : "" right now we ' re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka . "" pro - liberalisation congress mps also fear that such witch - hunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors . non - congress mps from maharashtra , meanwhile , claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue . "" i think i know vilasrao deshmukh ' s gameplan , "" says an mp from the state . but some mps like congress ' prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that ' s surrounded the deal : "" i ' ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this "" .  the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a techno - economic appraisal , as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act of 1948 and related legislations , the infirmities could have been avoided . since this wasn ' t done , questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise , the exhaustive 93 - page report points out .  "" i ' d highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit , "" says congress mp prithviraj chavan .  the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early ' 90 s and , despite several controversies , is now an established power project at dabhol , 150 km south of mumbai . in july 1992 , enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) to set up a 2 , 550 mw station as part of the government ' s ' fast track ' projects .  subsequently , when the shiv - sena - bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project . this curiously led to renegotiations with enron . the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal . "" once it ( gom ) decided to revive the project , it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done . it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency . the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons , which was accepted by dabhol , is unprecedented . "" says chavan : "" i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned . ""  since the commissioning of the plant in may 1999 , the mseb has paid rs 1 , 607 crore for the power it has bought from dabhol . if the same watttage of power had been bought from indian - built power plants fired by indigenous coal , the payment would have been approximately rs 736 crore . in the first year - and - a - half of its operation itself , the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly rs 1 , 000 crore .  the central electricity authority ( cea ) , in fact , pointed out that the dabhol plant was not the least costly option . the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda , but they were in a preliminary stage . the report notes : "" . . . if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects , they might not have remained in their preliminary stages "" . it adds that the members were of the opinion that "" the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously , based on information available at that time , in proceeding with the dpc as a base - load factor even when its capacity was reduced . "" the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry , finance ministry and the cea . it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable , no further examination was required  strangely , bal thackeray ' s shiv sena , when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra , filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal .  after the new shiv sena - bjp government took over , its cm , manohar joshi , appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises , actually managing to reduce the tariff . but certain things remained inexplicable . no fresh clearances were required from the cea , which also said that "" since no cost increase was involved . . . fresh formal clearance wasn ' t necessary . "" says the committee : "" this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn ' t consider the economic aspects of the project at all . indeed , given the non - availability of any official record of the meeting on june 24 , 1994 , with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december 23 , 1994 , the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all . ' '  the credibility of the shiv sena - bjp government has been seriously questioned . "" the committee finds it unexplicable ( sic ) why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $ 2 , 828 million to $ 2 , 501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee , "" the panel observes . says lawyer prashant bhushan : "" it is strange that the shiv sena - bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal . "" the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal . "" subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc , the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid . while the mseb was in profit in 1998 - 99 , it plunged into huge losses of rs 1681 crore in 1999 - 2000 . ""  significantly , the world bank in 1993 had predicted the system ' s inherent weaknesses . in a letter written to the then power secretary , r . vasudevan , a top bank official had said that "" after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions , we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project , as presently formulated , is not economically justified "" and that in "" our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in 1998 . the proposed base - load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch , as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power . ""  enron ' s persistence and the ' gullibility ' of the indian side can be gauged from high - ranking enron official joe sutton ' s letter to a key indian official , ajit nimbalkar : "" i recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers . i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed . we ' ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on . the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington . ""  the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all ? for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project . according to the report , the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has , despite a faulty transmission and distribution ( t and d ) system , managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis .  maharashtra accounts for nearly one - fourth of the gross value of india ' s industrial sector . it ' s one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electrification . since ' 95 , the mseb has been adding to its generation . "" this improvement , which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb , exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered , "" the report points out . following a policy of cross - subsidy , roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised .  but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn ' t been much . in fact , the subsidy claim decreased from rs 630 crore in 1995 - 96 to rs 355 crore in 1998 - 99 , until in 1999 - 2000 it increased nearly five - fold to rs 2 , 084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit - from 15 to 41 paise - an increase of 173 per cent . "" the increase in the subsidy claim by rs 1 , 729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase costs , "" says the committee , adding : "" without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss , the mseb could be financially healthy . ""  but can that happen now since enron is here to stay ? the committee has come up with some far - reaching recommendations : make public all dabhol - related documents and agreements , restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power , restructure dpc financially , allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra , re - examine ppas in accordance with least - cost plans , and thoroughly reform the mseb . the committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion . the question is , can that be achieved in an unstable political environment ?  with priya sahgal  making of a scam  ? 1992 : centre invites enron to set up ' fast track ' power project  ? dec 1993 : first ppa signed with mseb  ? 1994 : enron starts construction  ? 1995 : sena - bjp govt scraps enron  ? 1996 : state govt renegotiates project  ? 1996 : 13 - day vajpayee govt approves counter - guarantee  ? may 1996 : state cabinet clears ppa  ? may 13 , 1999 : phase i commissioned  ? jul 1999 : financial closure for phase ii  ? oct 2000 : mseb defaults on payment , subsequently stops paying monthly bills  ? feb 6 , 2001 : enron invokes central government ' s counter - guarantee  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , monday , april 23 , 2001  mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march , renni abraham  the maharashtra state electricity board ' s ( mseb ) revenue collections in march 2001 stood at a record rs 968 crore . this was largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connections - - pegged at nearly 20 , 000 disconnections a month - - which resulted in compliance by consumers . with the dabhol power company ( dpc ) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table , the mseb has turned to putting its house in order .  as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis , the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record . for instance , mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march 31 , 2001 , at 45930 units , compared with the previous year ' s 45582 units , making it the top seb of the country in this respect . similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at 86 . 1 up from 84 . 6 per cent last fiscal . plant load factor is up to 72 . 78 per cent , compared with 71 . 7 per cent in 2000 .  the parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units , which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs 12 . 5 lakh . all other power stations in the state , without exception , also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award , a senior mseb official said . similarly , the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the iso 9002 certification .  a senior mseb official said : "" earlier mseb was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning . the agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals , while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head . in the recent past , the government has authorised mseb to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials , many of whom , including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions"

ham," p + option valuation model  mark ,  after recently reviewing the booking of the p + options , it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes ( i . e . the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions extended to two commodities ) .  the payoff for a call option is :  payoff = max ( 0 , a - b - k ) .  where :  a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex )  b = posting price = ( wti swap ) - ( posting basis )  k = posting bonus ( fixed ) .  the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg "" b "" of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg "" b "" and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices .  in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly .  regards ,  stinson gibner  v . p . research"

ham," patricia tlapek  brad ,  as per our previous discussions , vince wanted me to give you the background  on our request to bring patricia tlapek into the research group at the very  top end of the manager group . the justification for this was not only her  extraordinary performance in setting up our technical analysis section but  also our reliance on her to build this group and expand its scope .  this memo is in response to your request today to document our reasoning .  this past year patricia was extremely successful in building internal  clientele for her products and recommendations - she is now widely relied on  by gas , power , crude and equity marketers , as well as traders from the  calgary office . in addition , she developed and presented seminars to bring  traders up to speed on techniques in technical analysis .  also this last year patricia built and populates daily the research group ' s  intranet site on technical analysis .  as a crowning achievement ( but just the beginning ) , patricia was given the  authority to actually trade natural gas as jeff shankman , managing director ,  authorized her book for technical analysis trading .  currently , we are proceeding with the expansion of her group personnel - wise  and she is agressively working to gain authority from other groups to trade  live books on other energy commodities and energy - related equities .  for these reasons , we want to peg patricia ' s salary at the top of the pay  scale .  thanks for expediting this effort .  - - - mike"
