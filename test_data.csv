dear vince kaminski
thank you so much for the kind invitation for the meeting .
i have been always inspired by and having respect for the
recent revolutionary achievements of enron in the energy markets
my former employer mckinsey tokyo in fact featured
your company * s success in the last quarterly , and it clearly states
( in japanese though ) that the quantitative research capability at enron
is now at the world * s top level , which has been always behind the scene .
i am extremely honored to receive the email from you and in fact
interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field ;
however , very unfortunately i will have to come back to japan , or at
least to the east asian region , upon graduation due to an inevitable
family reason . my wife * s father passed away recently and an old
mother - in - law is now left alone without relatives . i understand that
enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing
the outdated japanese energy market , ( which by the way i strongly
hope ) so i may not have a very good chance of making contribution
at your company right now .
lastly , if you need a staff in tokyo in some future who understands
both the risk management analytics at the f 622 level and the local
language and business custome better than average , please contact
me any time . i will be happy to assist as much as possible .
yours sincerely ,

no problem . i shall do it this weekend .
also , i left you a message regarding grant masson ( a vp in my group
who left and went to work for el paso 2 months ago ) .
i made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year . i lost . he
wants to come back
after 2 months .
my recommendation is to take him back . he left on good terms and is quite
competent .
i would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other
side
of the fence may look greener , but in reality it may be painted hay . "" the
return of grant
masson "" would demonstrate that enron offers best long - term growth
opportunities ( and that
i am good manager ) .
grant would come back to his original vp position . can we short - circuit the
hiring procedures for a vp . grant ' s body is still warm and we can just
re - instate
him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required
to hire a vp .

dear vince
thank you for your recent enquiry concerning a complimentary pass to the
two - day garp convention . unfortunately , it is not garp ' s policy to allow
this for a number of reasons : garp is a not - for - profit organisation , will
much lower delegate fees ( and still the same overheads ) than other
conference organizers . garp ' s mission is to allow an educational forum for
furtherance of financial risk management and an opportunity to allow
networking and contact time between financial risk professionals . however ,
in an attempt to remain at ease with my speakers , i would like to offer a
50 % discount off the delegate fee for one of you colleagues in enron . this
will be for the two - day convention and will include the gala awards evening
on 13 th february , which had over three financial and risk professionals at
garp 2000 .
i trust that this is satisfactory . if you would like to take advantage of
this , please fax a completed registration form , along with a brief covering
note referring to this e - mail , and i will ensure that our administration
depart handle the relevant paper work . if you have any questions please do
not hesitate to contact me .
i look forward to your response and to meeting you in new york in february
( and receiving a copy of your presentation in a few days ) .
kind regards
andreas

dear garp 2001 speaker
this is just a quick note to keep you up - to - date with developments at the
garp 2001 convention , which will be held in new york between 12 th and 15 th
february , 2001 .
thus far , garp 2001 looks set to far exceed our expectations and garp
2000 . there has been a great deal of interest in the 2001 convention .
delegate bookings have been much higher than this time last year . as a
result , we are set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention
earlier this year . the three workshops and the one - day asset management
forum are also very well received and will probably reach full capacity . i
will of course provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of
the event .
regarding the event itself , i would like a few outstanding issues :
1 . presentations : can you please e - mail your presentation to me by 15 th
december , so that i have enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
delegate pack for the convention . ( given the break of the christmas and
new york period , and that the event is being held in new york , i am sure
you can appreciate that there are certain logistical factors that need to
be taken into account , hence the reason why the presentations are required
as soon as possible ) . this is purely for reproduction , we also request you
bring your presentation to the convention on the day in either a floppy
disc or a laptop .
2 . audio - visual requirements : can you please inform me of what
audio - visual requirements you may have ( 35 mm slides ; ohp ; lcd projection -
notably powerpoint ) .
3 . check list : i have attached a check list for your information . if you
have not returned this already , can you please read and fax it to my
colleague , claire as soon as possible .
if you have any questions or queries , please do not hesitate to contact
me , otherwise i eagerly await your response in due course .
i look forward to seeing you in new york in february .
kind regards

the oil and gas advisory
now that oi | and gas has entered a long - term bul | market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy deveioper in the us "" oil belt ""
and in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of miilions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oi | and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pieased to announce that the
aiberta energy & utiiity board has issued license no . o 330206 for the
company ' s wel | 11 - 16 - 24 - 2 the acadia project .
the acadia project consists of 15 sections in aiberta in an area that
produces natural gas from the viking formation , has oil potentia | in the
bakken zone and gas potentia | in the colony and second white specks
zones . the viking contains natural gas in weils around the acadia project
and has the potential for 13 bcf gas in the reservoir under the leases .
gas welis in the area have caicuiated aof rates up to 14 mmcf per day .
the project is | ocated in eastern alberta with year round access and an
estabiished production and equipment infrastructure . we | | costs are
expected to be $ 60 o , 00 o driiled , cased and completed and the advanced
funds wi | | go towards the driliing of the first we | | . each well on a | ease
earns emerson a 49 % working interest in one section .
emerson oi | and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pleased to announce that the land
lease has been surveyed and acquired regarding the acadia project .

produces natural gas from the viking formation , has oi | potential in the
bakken zone and gas potential in the colony and second white specks

earns emerson a 49 % working interest in one section .
symbo | - eogi
price - . 026
the vaiue of eogi ' s shares wi | | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the last two years .
3 . with multipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - miilions , eogi is selling for less than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . already
shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the overa | | market .
in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the
past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and
deveiopers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in
the last 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and even quadrupie
returns .
our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company
with a comparably smail market vaiue , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but all that wi | | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equaliy explosive effect on
the share price .
what wi | | the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oi | and gas ' shares ? wel | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in
the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or deciine
siightly , you will stiil make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wiil soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wiil be
staggering .
overall , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive
production . early investors wi | | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this area wi | | realiy turn up the heat , causing us to revise our
targets upward in next week ' s builetin .

1 . we can detect "" hoarding "" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against
the actual inflow .
2 . we can detect "" market power "" by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,
distinguishing between the physical "" cost "" in gas to run the generators and
the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .
3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect "" storage "" as the difference between inflow
and consumption .
it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model
of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market
prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing
capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas
prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for
the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :
hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can "" calibrate "" the
price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price
elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,
from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis
trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage
and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and
each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,
flows are "" explained "" by the model , and can be imputed from prices if
necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of
the weather .
i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a
model .

how can you sell this software as oem ? it seems too good to be true - is there a catch ?
there is no catch - the software versions that we sell are oem ( original equipment manufacturer )
which means you will receive the installation cds only ( they do not come in their original retail
packing and do not include the manual ) . we do guarantee that all programs are the 100 % full working
retail versions - no demos or academic versions ! when you order , you will receive all materials
required for a complete installation - or your money back ! why pay hundreds of dollars more when you
can get exactly the same but oem - cd ? you don ' t have to pay that much for the fancy box and manuals .
why is your software so inexpensive compared to the other retailers ?
we minimize our overhead by stocking mostly top selling software only and try to get the
best deals for them . we also sell what are called oem versions , the same software as the
box version without the box and the manual . by foregoing the fancy box and typically slim
manuals you end up saving a considerable amount .

"Subject: new basis report
bhavna :
the basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices . it is called
basisnw 7 . xls and is in the erg database .
it looks to be working correctly , but of course without data it is a little
hard to confirm . as always , it is ultimately your job to verify that the
numbers reported are correct . lemme know if there are problems .
it is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year . you should keep
this mail message as a reference .
1 ) add 12 to the expression in "" printmacro "" ! b 35 i . e . change
copy ( offset ( henrycash , 12 * againstyear + 63 , i , 12 , 1 ) ) to
2 ) define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be
printed out on the report page . for example , last year , the basis report
went from jan 93 to dec 1999 . in basisnw 6 . xls there is a name "" jan 93 "" defined
as "" basis "" ! a 64 ( i . e . refers to the row where the jan 1993 basis numbers are
recorded ) . this year , in basisnw 7 . xls , i defined "" jan 94 "" to refer to
"" basis "" ! a 76 . that ' s because the basis report will now run from jan 1994 to
dec 2000 .
3 ) change the expression in "" printmacro "" ! b 45 to use this new cell reference
i . e . change copy ( offset ( jan 93 , 12 * indexyear , report , 12 , 1 ) ) to
4 ) having executed steps 1 ) - 3 ) the spreadsheet will now print numbers
shifted up by one year . all that remains to do is to change the dates on the
"" printformat "" page to be one year more . by that i mean change 1998 to 1999 ,
1999 to 2000 , change 98 / 99 to 99 / 00 , etc . don ' t move any numbers or formulas !
that ' s it . as we discussed bhavna , while i am happy to do this for you , it
is not in your or my best interest for this to continue . please do work to
find some one in your shop to maintain this spreadsheet .

"Subject: revised : organizational changes
to : enron north america corp .
from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon
in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the
continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our
people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,
and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both
within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the
corporate goal of fostering 
b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers
including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and
mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,
textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream
coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .
downstream coverage / origination
as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both
ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron
corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function
will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy
commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities
but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,
plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels
groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper
will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s
leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three
sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :
a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage
activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for
the provision of innovative
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision
of paper risk management products ;
b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to
lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the
chemicals and refined products industries ;
c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers
trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the
coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,
heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles
and glass manufacturing industries .
midstream coverage / origination
a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on
energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas
utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern
interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this
group ;
b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on
energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas
utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they
will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring
opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the
leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from
calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;
c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on
the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant
power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked
mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will
continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern
interconnect ;
d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring
opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing
restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have
asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,
formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of
citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join
this newly formed business .
2 ) commercial transactions :
the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff
donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of
transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing
transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity
of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction
development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity
structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical
analysis and upstream asset management .
the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction
with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service
and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :
a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and
western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group
include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy
lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of
capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today
from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power
origination .
b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial
origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,
environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is
established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay
boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .
c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant
services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior
members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and
john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the
vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few
weeks .
d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer
finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include
brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition
of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .
ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and
downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary
responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will
continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior
commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual
responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the
capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain
largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction
development teams and their respective origination groups will be located
together .
we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage
and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial
markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between
the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .
please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north
america by working with us to implement these changes .",0

"Subject: california energy crisis
california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several
months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .
please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation
and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply
and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased
the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,
predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10
percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related
factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for
power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long
term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in
california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine
while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained
in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep
competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the
regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .
regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new
generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile
spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned
the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,
if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron  , s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix
the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the
politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the
state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the
same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a
market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products
for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from
the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we
protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply
power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on
the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western
power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers
with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more
demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the
state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market
and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .
increasing supply
california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing
short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less
than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply
must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and
displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new
facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .
they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail
market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand
at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer
term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands
of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .
opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their
price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to
greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to
arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is
needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,
while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters
worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;
and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,
which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how
ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley
or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current
shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in
california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,
constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in
california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power
generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads
and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the
crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real
solutions to the state .",0

"Subject: update on spring conference
hello everyone ,
i wanted to get a message out to each of you to update you on the february
23 conference plans . the conference promises to provide an exciting
opportunity to share the ideas of a diverse group of academic and industry
professionals on a topic that is dear to all our hearts , the future of
business education in the new economy . i will be sharing updates and
information with you over the weeks to come but thought it might be useful
to start before the holidays .
i am attaching the most recent "" description of the program of events "" which
remains somewhat fluid as we develop it . however , there are some new
developments that you will find interesting . first , i have arranged for
"" filming "" of the event by our local public tv station and we will be
working toward the development of the best product possible out of the
sessions . second , david palumbo ( human code - - an internet content
provider - http : / / www . humancode . com / index 2 . htm - now owned by sapient ) will
join us . david is very knowledgable about both educational issues ( he
served on the faculty of the university of houston for 10 years before
joining human code ) . he has some very interesting insights to offer on the
future of higher education having now worked from the industry side of the
equation ) . finally , i am currently reading a couple of books that you may
find interesting ( telecosm and the new barbarian manifesto ) . i ' m sure
there are many more interesting sources of information that you are each
aware of and it would be helpful if we all began sharing our notes .
finally , let me suggest that each of you begin thinking about the issue ( s )
that you feel most comfortable commenting upon and phrasing "" lead in ""
questions for me . i would like to build a list of such questions to
circulate among all so that we begin to get a feel for the range of topics
we will encounter in the discussion and begin to formulate our individual
opinions .
i hope that this note finds you all anticipating a wonderful holiday season
and thank you for participating in this inaugural "" think tank "" conference
on the future of business education .
sincerely yours ,

"Subject: gpcm summary 1999
this has been a great year for rbac and gpcm .
during the year we have doubled to 10 the number of gpcm licensees .
this means we ' ve also doubled the number of wonderful people we ' ve trained
and are supporting .
and , i sincerely mean it when i say it has been a real pleasure working
with you all .
one of the things we stress when we are selling gpcm is that it takes a
strong commitment on the part of the licensee , a commitment to find skilled
and dedicated people to make optimal use of this sophisticated tool . and ,
i ' m happy to report that we have that quality in the gpcm teams we work
with .
next year we have some big challenges . we will be converting the system
from office 97 to office 2000 and will also need to make sure it will run
in the windows 2000 environment .
we will be adding new flexibility in defining our transportation zone price
curves to enable users , especially pipeline users , to test variations of
pricing strategies for their impacts on basis and utilization .
we will be adding a capability for modeling future ft contracting .
we will upgrade our existing database comparison program to allow you to
select those items you want to have automatically updated in your own
databases .
we will continue to work with rdi to improve pipeline and storage
infrastructure representations , to provide interfaces between gasdat and
gpcm , and to give you regular optional updates for your own databases .
we are beginning to plan out a new website dedicated to gpcm licensees ( and
possibly prospects ) . we have acquired gpcm . rbac . com and gpcm . net for this
purpose .
in making these various changes , we look also to you , our existing
licensees , for enhancement and improvement ideas . we are planning to
conduct interviews of our licensees during the next 30 - 60 days to find
out what you like , but also what you would like to see improved , as well as
some new ideas for gpcm .
i would like to thank the following people for their contributions to gpcm
during 1999 .
o liam leahy for his excellent marketing , sales , and planning support
o charles carr for his quality work on our website and support with subtle
visual basic programming issues
o richard berman for thorough research on design tools and skilled windows
programming
o richard mcbride for continuing support and development of his emnet
optimization program
o aaron and james brooks for design and production of the powerpoint
pipeline maps now available in gpcm
o mike farina and rdi for their continuing improvement of the gpcm data and
gasdat database
o gpcm users who have found data bugs and reported them to use so that we
could get them corrected
o gpcm users who have suggested new features which would make gpcm a better
product
o gpcm users who have given us sales leads during the year
o gpcm users who have used gpcm to help their companies make better plans
and decisions , which is , after all , the purpose for which it was designed
we hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season and look forward to an
even better year 2000 .

"Subject: re : working gas price model
vince -
i have a simplified version of brad ' s model in mind .
the "" no arbitrage "" condition equates trading margins across the country .
costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network . wellhead supply is
almost completely price - elastic , while burner - tip demand is almost
completely price inelastic . storage is rationalized as a perpetual call
option .
the least time - variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing
gas from storage to the pipeline , followed by the costs of delivering gas
from the wellhead to the pipeline . the intermediate - variant parameters are
the capacity - dependent costs paid to the pipeline ( above shrinkage ) for
transmission . the most time - variant parameters are the trading margins and
the valuations of the storage option .
there are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork .
they are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways : using a short
time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability
mentioned above , or point - estimates ( "" calibrations "" ) using only today ' s data
based on a node - based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with
the same region of origination , albeit markedly different terminus , price
versus capacity similarly , "" competing "" for outflows .
i will write this up for you in scientific word and present it to you at your
earliest convenience .

the value of eogi ' s shares will skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest buil

2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the | ast two years .
3 . with multipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi - miliions , eogi is seiling for less than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . already
shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the overa | | market .
in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the
past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and

slightly , you wil | stil | make a very healthy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings

staggering .

subject : re : meter 1428 oct 99 - beaumont methanol
lee ,
i need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue .
first , you show a deal volume of 20 , 000 on nov . 7 and the pipeline confirmed
this volume . is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol ? this
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says , the volume confirmed by
hpl , and dorcheus ' s volume .
second , the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june 2000 per
julie meyers notes she sends out every month ( last note sent dec 3 and you
are on distribution list ) . brandywine has nothing to do with this issue . it
is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol .
do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
buyback ?
this is a commercial issue that i need further clarification from you if you
have a buyback in place or not . if not , please notify julie and note on the
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective .
if it is still active , please contact chyral and resolve .
let me know the final resolution .

i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29 th and 30 th , a
total of 660 mmbtu . the problem is there is nothing in the system for meter #
9813 for 11 / 99 production . i looked in sitara , ( sitara # 132030 ) and the
deal starts for 12 / 99 production . i checked with donald to make sure and
he says that the meter did start up 11 / 29 and the price is hsc less $ . 10 . in
order to get this deal into the system , who do i need to talk to ? ? ?
thanks , stephanie ( 3 - 6004 )",0

i crave your indulgence at this mail coming from somebody you have not know before . i decided to do this after praying over the situation . you should please consider the transaction on its content and not the fact that you have not known me before . i need not dwell on how i came by your contact information because there are many such possibilities these days .

looking for a credible person to whom i will pass the right of next of kin . this person will apply to the bank and request for the transfer of the fund to his / her bank account . this is on the condition that you will take 25 % of the fund for yourself , 5 % used for expenses , while you will use the remaining 70 % for the less previlege people in the society .
this is in fulfilment of the last request of my husband : that a substantial part of the fund be used to carter for the less previleged . if this condition is acceptable to you , you should contact me immediately with your full names and contact information so that i will ask our family lawyer to prepare the authorization that will give you the right of next of kin to the account in the bank . i will also give you a text of the application you are to send to the bank . i cannot predict what will be my fate by the time the fund willbe transfered into your account , but you should please ensure that the fund is used as i have described above .
i look forward to your response .

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

vince ,
our goal is to validate that the enron global market book
administrators are accurately using the "" spread option model "" as developed by
the research group . to determine this , we would like to provide you with
the inputs for a particular deal ( as provided by a global markets book
administrator ) and have you recalculate the deal value . we will then
compare your results to the values calculated by global markets .
two koch deals have been chosen due to their substantial p / l effect . i have
attached the deal data in two forms : ( 1 ) the spread option model that kara
boudreau , book administrator egm , provided and ( 2 ) an excel spreadsheet that
isolates the 2 deals .
if there is anything more that we could provide , please don ' t hesitate to
call me at x 30968 .

subject : eol deal ids in path manager
as you ' re aware , we ' re having to bridge houston street ids into unify from
sitara .
we are being asked , as a requirement , to not display the eol id on statements
that are identified as "" broker eol trade "" deals originating from eol . we
have two options to accomodate this requirement :
option 1 is to have the modify the bridge code to not bridge over the eol
deal id if the deal is a "" broker eol trade "" deal . one of the drawbacks of
this option is that you won ' t be able to referenence the eol id on the path
manager for these related deals . all other deals will have the eol deal id ,
if applicable . the eol id would not show up on the statements because it
wouldn ' t be populated .
option 2 is to modify several areas of code in the settlements area which may
be more time consuming . the obvious code change would be in the statement
generation area as well as other report type information .
option 2 allows you the greatest flexibility while option 1 may be quicker to
implement .
please pass this along to others in your group and get feedback . please
share your thoughts . . . .
i ' ve attached an email explaining the broker eol trades . this is not to be
confused with broker deals done at a given point with not transportation .
these will continue to come across as you ' d normally expect .
any questions , please ask . . .

hi shirley ,
i would like to request for a new pc . my current pc is quite old with not
enough memory . twice

their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new pc . given that dell has pentiumc iii
processor at 800 mhz
on market , i would like to request a pc with process at 500 mhz or higher
level .
thank you very much .

case study guidelines
1 . model should be for a particular market . examples : pjm , chicago , ecar ,
southern california . lb ( optional ) . model should be for a particular purpose . examples : valuing a
new combustion turbine at the florida / georgia border , bidding on a portfolio
of power plants up for sale in nepool , valuing a retail portfolio in
pennsylvania .
2 . model should be estimated on a particular data set . examples : daily
nymex
close prices for palo verde , pjm hourly spot prices for 1998 - 1999 .
3 . case study should describe several candidate models , for volatility
and / or market price , that were considered . case study should discuss why
these models were considered . candidate models should be described
mathematically and verbally .
4 . evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
identified , and quantified to the extent possible . examples of evaluation
criteria : residuals that are not autorcorrelated , stationarity , r - squared ,
akaike information criterion .
5 . parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed . the
estimation procedure employed should be briefly described .
6 . some diagnostics of model fit ( vis - a - vis data set ) should be presented .
7 . if possible , predictive power of model should be assessed .
generally , the case study should include all of the items above . the case
study may include other things .",0

copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the
electronic document management system . while ena is not liable for pre - 2000
business , we may need to assist with research as issues arise . in order to
get the ball rolling , we need to get a list together of the reports we need .
please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need
and return it to me by friday , 1 / 15 / 2000 . if you do not want any reports ,
please send me an email letting me know that . i have included samples of how
to fill this out , and if you have any questions please give me a call .
if you aren ' t sure which reports you need based on the names , please get with
any ces employees you have hired or with a ces transition employee to get
clarification . if you need samples of any of these reports please let my

clay ,
i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period . we feel this would be an easier process to
work
through if ena knows what kind of information they can request as we go
through
the transition .

certain flaws are necessary for the whole . it would seem strange if old friends lacked certain quirks .
ideally a book would have no order to it , and the reader would have to discover his own . no one is more profoundly sad as one who laughs too much .
a friend is , as it were , a second self .
just as women are afraid of receiving , men are afraid of giving .
the greatest evil is physical pain .
our expenses are all for conformity .
the brave person thinks of themselves last of all .
the intellect is a very nice whirligig toy , but how people take it seriously is more than i can understand .
if you argue with a woman and win , you lose .
if you can ' t get a compliment any other way , pay yourself one .
when a subject becomes totally obsolete we make it a required course .
men naturally resent it when women take greater liberties in dress than men are allowed .
language is the mother of thought , not its handmaiden . ideas won ' t work unless you do . initiative is doing the right thing without being told .
a symphony is a stage play with the parts written for instruments instead of for actors .

"Subject: re : hdaf seminar topics
folks :
i have tentatively set the date for our first round - table discussion for
wednesday ,
december 20 th at 3 : 00 pm - 4 : 30 pm . the room , eb 3268 , will be available from
3 : 00 to 5 : 00 pm . if any of you have an issue with the date , please let me
know by
day ' s end .
professor don kouri of the physics department of the university of houston
will start
with an informal 30 - 45 minute presentation ( see appended abstract below ) of
his work
and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have .
professor kouri , please let me know if you have any requirements for
audiovisual
or other equipment .
this excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the
subject of our meeting :
[ . . . ] topics to
be discussed at a small ` ` roundtable ' ' format meeting , are :
1 . hdafs for data analysis , including ` ` gap - filling ' ' , data
extrapolation , denoising , mathematical manipulations of digital
data ( e . g . , taking derivatives , applying functions of differential
operators to digital data , etc . )
2 . hdafs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations , particularly for equations for which
existing methods encounter stability problems .
there are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
hdafs but i think that even trying to do both of the above in a
single meeting would be difficult . of course , in this first meeting
we would focus on general aspects of the hdafs that make them robust
for such applications . if , however , you have other topics in which
you are interested , i am willing to focus on them .

this first meeting with dr . kouri will introduce the participants to his area
of research ( hdafs for data analysis ) and allow us to define the contents and
attendants of a seminar ( to come up soon ) .
we are looking to hold this discussion this week ( hopefully ) and to have the
seminar happen before christmas ( given that this is the in - between semester

a couple of other similar meetings will follow up : dr kevin bassler will be
talking about microscopic simulation of economic markets and dr . pinsky about

attached is a file with my allocations of texas operations to be used for the
2000 plan . however , please note that their are some problems / clean - up that
needs to occur that i could not do .
as you requested , i have taken the % we allocated to gas assets last year and
put the appropriate % ' s into the appropriate group within gas assets as you
have broken them out . please note : gas network trading is the same group as
st gastexas ( group 8 ) - tom martin is responsible for both . i have indicated
the appropriate % ' s into the new buckets , but i was not able to zero out the
st gastexas group as the cells are protected . consequently , the total column
indicates that i have allocated over 100 % . the # ' s in gas network trading
are correct . will you please delete st gastexas so that no one will allocate
to it ?
when the plan allocations were submitted last year , there was an error in
rcl 160 - volume management . i thought we corrected it but it is still
showing up incorrectly . please move the 8 % under east origin to st gaseast .
i was not able to correct this either as the cells have been protected .
please note : this is not a change from the plan , but a correction of an
error .
i would appreciate you correcting these things for me , and forwarding the
corrected version back to me for my records . i will be working with our
management team on the 1 / 00 allocations , and will provide you those by
friday . please call me if you have any questions . thanks .

* at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency
identification ) technology . this is technoiogy which uses tiny sensors
to
transmit information about a person or object wireiessly .
* vnbl is aiready an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location
technoiogy .
* vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies
and
governments to wireiessly track their assets and resources . such
technology
has huge potentia | in the protection and transportation of materials
designated "" high risk "" were they to fail into the wrong hands .
* vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order
to
create "" high security space "" in | ocales where it is deemed necessary .
locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea
ports ,
mines , nuciear facilities , and more .

news on vnbl
malibu , caiif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2 oo 5 - - vinobie , inc .
( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a hoiding company seeking to identify | ong - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and
services that wi | | assist in the automation of the identification and
control of equipment , assets , tools , and the reiated processes used in
the
oil & gas and petrochemica | industries .
aithough sma | | wireiessiy networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they
can
aiso deliver safety features within oi | welis . oi | maybe trapped in
different | ayers of rock , aiong with gas and water . detection of
specific
| iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a well filiing with water .
as with other rf based technoiogy appiications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materiais by oniy the authorized handier , and | imit the
entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is
essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags wouid
enable the customer to track and evaiuate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentiaily hazardous conditions , but gives
vaiuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid
can
aiso assist the customer ' s suppiy chain by tracking oi | , gas , and
chemica |
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail | eve | .
vinobie ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are
more
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fueis and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company beiieves that such offering service and technology
application
in the oi | & gas and petrochemica | industry will further position
vinobie in
a rapidiy expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and giobal spending that the company wi | | require
for
growth . the company ' s goa | is to also provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageable to even the smaliest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is
exceptiona | . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truiy
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .

vince ,
bijoya is currently working on the development of the website for the new
credit trading initiative , and we thought it would be a good idea to put my
recent technical article "" measuring credit risk "" on it . are you okay with
this release , or does it contain any proprietary information we should edit
